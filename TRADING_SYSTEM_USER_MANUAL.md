## Portfolio Analysis

### Multi-Strategy Consensus Analysis

Use all 6 strategies simultaneously to get a consensus recommendation.

#### How It Works

1. **Select Allocation Profile**
   - **Conservative**: Favors dividend and mean reversion (lower risk)
   - **Balanced**: Equal weight across all strategies
   - **Aggressive**: Favors small-cap and momentum (higher risk)
   - **Growth**: Emphasizes momentum and upgrades
   - **Value**: Focuses on contrarian and dividend

2. **Enter Stock Symbol**

3. **Review Consensus**
   - Weighted average of all strategy recommendations
   - Individual strategy results available
   - Confidence calculated based on agreement

#### Example: Portfolio Analysis

```
Symbol: TSLA
Profile: Balanced
Date: 2024-12-02

CONSENSUS: BUY
Weighted Confidence: 72%

Individual Results:
┌────────────────────┬────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│ Strategy           │ Action │ Confidence │ Weight     │
├────────────────────┼────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
│ SmallCapCatalyst   │ HOLD   │ 45%        │ 15% (6.8%) │
│ IPlace             │ BUY    │ 78%        │ 15% (11.7%)│
│ MeanReversion      │ HOLD   │ 52%        │ 15% (7.8%) │
│ QualityDividend    │ SELL   │ 35%        │ 20% (7.0%) │
│ MomentumQuality    │ BUY    │ 88%        │ 20% (17.6%)│
│ Contrarian         │ BUY    │ 82%        │ 15% (12.3%)│
└────────────────────┴────────┴────────────┴────────────┘

Consensus Reasoning:
Majority of strategies (3 of 6) recommend BUY with strong confidence. 
Momentum Quality and Contrarian strategies show highest confidence. 
Quality Dividend signals caution due to low yield. Overall signal 
strength is MODERATE due to some disagreement.

Recommendation: BUY with moderate confidence. Consider position sizing 
at 10-15% of portfolio rather than full 20% due to mixed signals.

```

**Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
```
Example: 65% means 13 winners out of 20 trades
```

**Profit Factor**: Gross profits ÷ gross losses
```
> 2.0 = Excellent
1.5 - 2.0 = Good
1.0 - 1.5 = Acceptable
< 1.0 = Losing strategy
```

**Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
```
> 2.0 = Excellent
1.0 - 2.0 = Good
0.5 - 1.0 = Acceptable
< 0.5 = Poor
```

**Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
```
Example: -15% means worst drop from peak to bottom was 15%
```

**Average Win/Loss**: Mean profit per winning/losing trade
```
Want: Avg Win > Avg Loss (ideally 2x or more)
```

## Advanced Features

### Sector & Industry Analysis

**NEW FEATURE**: Compare stock performance against sector benchmarks and peer companies.

#### What is Sector Analysis?

Sector analysis helps you understand how a stock performs relative to its industry peers and sector average. This context is critical for determining if a stock's gains are due to company-specific factors or broader sector trends.

**Why it matters**:
- A stock up 20% in a sector up 25% is actually **underperforming**
- A stock down 5% in a sector down 15% is **outperforming**
- Sector rotation can signal market regime changes

#### GICS Sector Classification

Stocks are categorized using the **Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)**:

| Sector Code | Sector Name | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| 10 | Energy | XOM, CVX, SLB |
| 15 | Materials | DOW, LYB, NEM |
| 20 | Industrials | BA, CAT, UNP |
| 25 | Consumer Discretionary | AMZN, TSLA, HD |
| 30 | Consumer Staples | PG, KO, WMT |
| 35 | Health Care | JNJ, UNH, PFE |
| 40 | Financials | JPM, BAC, GS |
| 45 | Information Technology | AAPL, MSFT, NVDA |
| 50 | Communication Services | GOOGL, META, NFLX |
| 55 | Utilities | NEE, DUK, SO |
| 60 | Real Estate | AMT, PLD, SPG |

#### Classifying Stocks by Sector

**In the System**:
```
Dashboard > Analysis > Sector Classification

Enter Symbol: NVDA
```

**Example Output**:
```
Symbol: NVDA
Sector: Information Technology (Code: 45)
Industry: Semiconductors
Market Cap: $2.1T

```

#### Sector Rotation Detection

**What it is**: Identifying which sectors are gaining or losing momentum.

**Why it matters**:
- Early sign of market regime changes
- Helps rebalance portfolio allocation
- Indicates economic cycle shifts

**How to use**:
```
Dashboard > Analysis > Sector Rotation

Lookback Period: 30 days
```

**Example Output**:
```
Sector Leaders (Past 30 Days):
1. Information Technology: +12.5% (strong uptrend)

Sector Laggards (Past 30 Days):
1. Energy: -7.8% (strong downtrend)
2. Utilities: -5.2% (downtrend)
3. Consumer Staples: -3.5% (downtrend)

Rotation Status: ✅ ROTATION DETECTED
- Spread: 20.3% (Tech to Energy)
- Interpretation: Strong rotation into growth sectors

Investment Implications:
✅ Growth > Value rotation
✅ Favor tech, communication, discretionary
⚠️ Reduce defensive positions (utilities, staples)
⚠️ Energy weakness may indicate economic slowdown concerns
```

#### Relative Strength Analysis

**What it is**: Measures how stock performs relative to its sector over time.

**Relative Strength Ratio = Stock Return / Sector Return**

**How to interpret**:
- **RS Ratio > 1.5**: Significantly outperforming
- **RS Ratio 1.1-1.5**: Outperforming  
- **RS Ratio 0.9-1.1**: In line with sector
- **RS Ratio 0.5-0.9**: Underperforming
- **RS Ratio < 0.5**: Significantly underperforming

**Example**:
```
Symbol: JPM (Financials)
Period: 90 days

Stock Return: +24.0%
Sector Return: +12.0%
RS Ratio: 2.0 (24% / 12%)

Interpretation: Significantly outperforming sector
- Company-specific catalysts strong
- Consider maintaining/increasing position
```

#### Practical Usage Examples

**Scenario 1: Evaluating a Buy Signal**
```
Strategy says: BUY NVDA (80% confidence)

Check Sector Analysis:
- NVDA Return: +82% (90 days)
- Tech Sector: +18%
- RS Ratio: 4.56 (exceptional outperformance)
- Sector Trend: Strong uptrend
- Sector Rank: #1 out of 75

Decision: 
✅ Strong BUY - Both stock AND sector showing strength
✅ Momentum likely to continue
✅ Sector tailwinds supporting individual performance
```

**Scenario 2: Warning Sign**
```
Strategy says: BUY XYZ (75% confidence)

Check Sector Analysis:
- XYZ Return: +5%
- Sector Return: +22%
- RS Ratio: 0.23 (significantly underperforming)
- Sector Rank: #68 out of 70

Decision:
⚠️ CAUTION - Stock lagging its strong sector
⚠️ Investigate why stock is weak when peers are strong
⚠️ May indicate company-specific problems
→ Reduce confidence or skip trade
```

**Scenario 3: Sector Rotation Trade**
```
Sector Rotation shows:
- Energy dropping from leader to laggard
- Tech rising from laggard to leader

Action:
1. Reduce energy positions
2. Increase tech exposure
3. Update portfolio allocations:
   - Tech: 25% → 35%
   - Energy: 15% → 5%
```

#### Best Practices

**✅ DO**:
- Always check sector context before trading
- Use sector rotation to time entries/exits
- Compare multiple stocks in same sector
- Track relative strength trends over time
- Rebalance when rotation is detected

**❌ DON'T**:
- Ignore sector trends when evaluating stocks
- Buy a "strong" stock in a collapsing sector
- Overlook outperformers in weak sectors (they're rare gems)
- Trade without understanding sector dynamics
- Assume sector trends continue forever

#### Integration with Trading Strategies

Each strategy now includes sector analysis:

**Momentum Quality Strategy + Sector Analysis**:
```
Before: Buy stock with strong momentum
After: Buy stock with strong momentum in strong sector
→ Higher win rate, better risk-adjusted returns
```

**Mean Reversion Strategy + Sector Analysis**:
```
Before: Buy oversold stock
After: Buy oversold stock in neutral/strong sector
→ Avoid catching falling knives in collapsing sectors
```

**Contrarian Strategy + Sector Analysis**:
```
Before: Buy panic-sold stock
After: Buy panic-sold stock if sector fundamentals intact
→ Distinguish temporary panic from permanent decline
```

### Index Benchmarking & Market Comparison

**Compare Your Stocks Against Major Market Indexes**

The system tracks and compares performance against major market benchmarks to measure alpha (excess returns), beta (market sensitivity), and relative strength.

#### Supported Market Indexes

| Index Symbol | Index Name | Description | Constituents |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **SPY** | S&P 500 | Large-cap US stocks | 500 companies |
| **QQQ** | NASDAQ 100 | Technology-focused index | 100 companies |
| **DIA** | Dow Jones Industrial Average | Blue-chip US stocks | 30 companies |
| **IWM** | Russell 2000 | Small-cap US stocks | 2000 companies |

#### Stock vs Index Comparison

Compare individual stock performance to relevant market benchmarks:

```php
$comparison = $indexService->compareToIndex('NVDA', 'SPY', '2024-01-01', '2024-12-01');
```

**Example Output**:
```
Stock: NVDA
Index: S&P 500 (SPY)
Period: 90 days

Stock Performance:
- Total Return: +82.5%
- Volatility: 38.2% (annualized)
- Sharpe Ratio: 2.16

Index Performance:
- Total Return: +18.3%
- Volatility: 14.5%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.26

Comparative Metrics:
- Alpha (Annualized): +64.2% ✅ Exceptional excess return
- Beta: 1.85 (85% more volatile than market)
- Correlation: 0.72 (strong positive relationship)
- Tracking Error: 22.1% (significant divergence)
- Excess Return: +64.2%
- Information Ratio: 2.91 (excellent risk-adjusted outperformance)

Interpretation: NVDA significantly outperformed S&P 500
→ Strong alpha generation
→ Higher volatility than market (beta 1.85)
→ Consider appropriate position sizing
```

#### Understanding Alpha & Beta

**Alpha (α)**: Excess return beyond what the market delivered
- **Positive Alpha**: Outperformance (e.g., +15% alpha = beat market by 15%)
- **Negative Alpha**: Underperformance (e.g., -8% alpha = lagged market by 8%)
- **Zero Alpha**: Matched market returns

**Beta (β)**: Sensitivity to market movements
- **β = 1.0**: Moves in line with market
- **β > 1.0**: More volatile than market (e.g., β=1.5 = 50% more volatile)
- **β < 1.0**: Less volatile than market (e.g., β=0.7 = 30% less volatile)
- **β ≈ 0**: Uncorrelated with market

**Example Interpretations**:
```
Stock A: Alpha = +12%, Beta = 1.5
→ Great returns BUT higher risk
→ Good for aggressive portfolios
→ Expect larger swings

Stock B: Alpha = +5%, Beta = 0.8
→ Modest outperformance with lower risk
→ Good for conservative portfolios
→ Smoother ride

Stock C: Alpha = -3%, Beta = 1.2
→ Underperformance with higher risk
→ ⚠️ Worst of both worlds
→ Likely candidate for replacement
```

#### Index Membership Detection

The system can estimate if a stock is likely included in major indexes:

```php
$membership = $indexService->isLikelyInIndex('AAPL', 'SPY');
```

**Example Output**:
```
Symbol: AAPL
Index: S&P 500

Likely Member: ✅ YES
Confidence: 95%
Reason: Large-cap stock with $3.0T market cap exceeds S&P 500 threshold ($10B+)

Market Cap: $3,000,000,000,000
Sector: Information Technology
```

**Detection Criteria**:
- **S&P 500**: Market cap > $10B, US domiciled, high liquidity
- **NASDAQ 100**: Market cap > $10B, tech/growth focus, NASDAQ-listed
- **Dow Jones**: Market cap > $100B, blue-chip reputation
- **Russell 2000**: Market cap $300M - $5B (small-cap range)

#### Correlation Analysis

Understand how closely your stock moves with the market:

**Correlation Scale**:
- **+1.0**: Perfect positive correlation (moves identically)
- **+0.7 to +1.0**: Strong positive relationship
- **+0.3 to +0.7**: Moderate positive relationship
- **-0.3 to +0.3**: Weak/no relationship
- **-0.7 to -0.3**: Moderate negative relationship
- **-1.0 to -0.7**: Strong negative relationship

**Example**:
```
NVDA vs S&P 500:
- Correlation: 0.72
- Interpretation: Strong positive correlation
- Meaning: When S&P 500 rises, NVDA usually rises (but more volatile)
- Use case: NVDA captures market uptrends with amplification

GLD (Gold ETF) vs S&P 500:
- Correlation: -0.15
- Interpretation: Weak negative correlation
- Meaning: Gold moves independently of stocks
- Use case: Portfolio diversification benefit
```

#### Information Ratio & Sharpe Ratio

**Information Ratio**: Measures consistency of alpha generation
```
Information Ratio = Excess Return / Tracking Error

High IR (>1.0): Consistent outperformance with controlled risk
Low IR (<0.5): Inconsistent or risky outperformance
Negative IR: Consistent underperformance
```

**Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Return - Risk-free Rate) / Volatility

Excellent: >2.0
Very Good: 1.5-2.0
Good: 1.0-1.5
Fair: 0.5-1.0
Poor: <0.5
```

#### Practical Usage Examples

**Scenario 1: Portfolio Benchmark Selection**
```
Analyzing portfolio of 10 stocks

Step 1: Compare to multiple indexes
- vs S&P 500: Beta 1.2, Alpha +5%
- vs Russell 2000: Beta 0.9, Alpha +12%
- vs NASDAQ 100: Beta 1.1, Alpha +3%

Step 2: Choose best benchmark
→ Russell 2000 is best fit (lowest beta, highest alpha)
→ Portfolio is small-cap focused
```

**Scenario 2: Risk Assessment**
```
Stock XYZ Analysis:
- Return: +45% (90 days)
- vs S&P 500: Beta 2.1, Alpha +25%

Interpretation:
⚠️ Stock is 2.1x more volatile than market
→ Position sizing: Reduce by 50% vs normal
→ Set tighter stop losses
→ Expect large daily swings
✅ But generating strong alpha (+25%)
```

**Scenario 3: Performance Attribution**
```
Stock returned +30% while S&P 500 returned +10%

Question: Was this skill or just market beta?

Answer:
- Beta: 1.5
- Expected return from market: 10% × 1.5 = 15%
- Actual return: 30%
- Alpha: 30% - 15% = +15%

Conclusion: 
- 15% from market exposure (beta)
- 15% from stock-specific alpha ✅
→ Manager added real value
```

**Scenario 4: Index Fund Selection**
```
Want to add index exposure to portfolio

Current holdings:
- All large-cap tech stocks
- High correlation with NASDAQ 100

Decision:
❌ Don't add QQQ (would increase concentration)
✅ Add IWM (Russell 2000) for small-cap diversification
✅ Or add DIA (Dow) for blue-chip value exposure
```

#### Best Practices

**✅ DO**:
- Compare every stock to relevant benchmark
- Use beta for position sizing (lower beta = larger position)
- Track alpha consistency over time
- Choose benchmark that matches portfolio style
- Rebalance when correlations shift dramatically

**❌ DON'T**:
- Compare small-cap stocks to S&P 500 (use Russell 2000)
- Ignore beta when calculating position sizes
- Chase high returns without considering risk-adjusted metrics
- Use single benchmark for diversified portfolio
- Assume past correlations persist indefinitely

#### Integration with Strategies

**Momentum Quality + Index Benchmarking**:
```
Before: Buy stock with strong momentum
After: Buy stock with positive alpha AND momentum
→ Avoid stocks riding market beta without skill
```

**Mean Reversion + Index Benchmarking**:
```
Before: Buy oversold stock
After: Buy stock with positive alpha that's temporarily oversold
→ Focus on quality stocks having bad days
```

**Risk Management + Index Benchmarking**:
```
Position size based on beta:
- Beta 0.8: Standard position
- Beta 1.5: Reduce position by 40%
- Beta 2.0: Reduce position by 50%
→ Maintain consistent portfolio volatility
```

### ETF, Mutual Fund & Segregated Fund Analysis

**NEW FEATURE**: Analyze fund composition, compare fees across MER tiers, check client eligibility, and identify upgrade opportunities.

#### Understanding Fund Types

**ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)**:
- Trades like a stock on an exchange
- Typically lower fees than mutual funds
- Intraday trading
- Tax efficient

**Mutual Fund**:
- Priced once per day at NAV
- May have front-end or back-end loads
- Professionally managed
- Often higher MER than ETFs

**Segregated Fund (Seg Fund)**:
- Insurance product with death benefit guarantees
- Creditor protection in certain jurisdictions
- Often based on underlying ETF or mutual fund
- Multiple fund codes for same underlying fund
- Different MERs based on client eligibility

**Index Fund**:
- Tracks a specific market index
- Passive management
- Lowest fees

#### MER Tiers Explained

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: Annual fee charged by fund, expressed as percentage of assets.

Seg funds often have multiple versions (fund codes) with different MERs:

| Tier | MER Range | Net Worth Minimum | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **RETAIL** | 2.0-2.5% | $0 | Available to all clients, highest fees |
| **PREFERRED** | 1.5-1.9% | $250,000 | Mid-tier pricing |
| **PREMIUM** | 1.0-1.4% | $500,000 | Lower fees for higher net worth |
| **INSTITUTIONAL** | 0.5-0.9% | $1,000,000+ | Lowest fees, highest minimums |

**Important**: All tiers hold the same underlying assets—only the fee differs.

#### Client Eligibility

**What it checks**:
- Client's personal net worth
- Family net worth (if fund allows aggregation)
- Minimum investment amount
- Advisor approval requirements

**Example**:
```
Client: $400,000 net worth
Spouse: $200,000 net worth
Family net worth: $600,000

Fund ABC - RETAIL: Qualified (no minimum)
Fund ABC - PREFERRED: Qualified (needs $250k)
Fund ABC - PREMIUM: Qualified via family aggregation (needs $500k)
Fund ABC - INSTITUTIONAL: Not qualified (needs $1M)
```

**Family Aggregation**: Some funds allow combining household net worth to qualify for lower MER tiers.

#### Analyzing Fund Holdings

**What you get**:
```php
$composition = $fundService->getFundComposition('XIC.TO');

Returns:
- Holdings list (symbol, name, weight, shares, value)
- Sector allocation (Technology 28%, Financials 24%, etc.)
- Asset class breakdown (Equity 95%, Cash 5%)
- Geographic exposure (Canada 60%, US 30%, International 10%)
- Concentration metrics:
  * Top 10 holdings concentration (e.g., 45% of portfolio)
  * HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) - diversification measure
```

**Interpretation**:
- **HHI < 1,000**: Highly diversified
- **HHI 1,000-1,800**: Moderately concentrated
- **HHI > 1,800**: Highly concentrated
- **Top 10 > 50%**: Significant concentration risk

#### Comparing Fund Overlap

**What it does**: Identifies holdings common to multiple funds to avoid redundancy.

**Example**:
```php
$overlap = $fundService->compareFundOverlap('XIC.TO', 'XIU.TO');

Returns:
- Shared holdings: [AAPL 8%, MSFT 6%, GOOGL 5%]
- Total weighted overlap: 82%
- Interpretation: Very High Redundancy
- Recommendation: Consider diversifying to different sectors/regions
```

**Overlap Levels**:
- **<20%**: Minimal overlap—good diversification
- **20-50%**: Moderate overlap—acceptable
- **50-80%**: High overlap—consider alternatives
- **>80%**: Very high redundancy—portfolio inefficiency

**Use case**: Before buying a second fund, check overlap to ensure you're not duplicating holdings.

#### Comparing MER Tiers (Fee Projections)

**What it calculates**: Shows long-term cost difference between MER tiers.

**Example**:
```php
$comparison = $fundService->compareMERs('ABC-BASE', 100000);

Investment: $100,000
Annual return assumption: 6%

| Tier | MER | Annual Fee | 10-Year Fees | 25-Year Fees | Final Value (25Y) |
|------|-----|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| INSTITUTIONAL | 0.75% | $750 | $9,800 | $33,500 | $398,400 |
| PREMIUM | 1.25% | $1,250 | $16,200 | $55,000 | $375,200 |
| PREFERRED | 1.75% | $1,750 | $22,600 | $76,500 | $352,800 |
| RETAIL | 2.25% | $2,250 | $29,000 | $98,000 | $331,200 |

Savings (Institutional vs Retail):
- 10 years: $19,200
- 25 years: $64,500 ($67,200 difference in final value)
```

**Key insight**: MER differences compound significantly over time.

#### Identifying Upgrade Opportunities

**What it does**: Checks if client qualifies for lower-MER version of funds they already own.

**Example**:
```php
$eligible = $fundService->filterByEligibility(
    clientNetWorth: 600000,
    familyNetWorth: 0,
    fundSymbols: ['ABC-RETAIL', 'XYZ-PREFERRED']
);

Results:
✓ ABC-RETAIL: Currently held, eligible for PREMIUM upgrade
  → Save $500/year on $100k position
✓ XYZ-PREFERRED: Optimal tier
```

**Action**: Advisor initiates fund code swap (usually no tax consequence for registered accounts).

#### Analyzing Fund Performance

**What it calculates**: Fund returns vs benchmark, adjusting for fees.

**Example**:
```php
$performance = $fundService->analyzeFundPerformance(
    fundSymbol: 'XIC.TO',
    benchmark: 'SPY',
    startDate: '2023-01-01',
    endDate: '2024-12-31'
);

Returns:
- Fund return: 12.5%
- Fund return after fees: 10.3% (MER 2.2%)
- Benchmark return: 11.8%
- Alpha: -1.5% (underperformed benchmark)
- Fund beta: 0.95
- Correlation: 0.88 (moves with benchmark)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Alpha > 0**: Outperforming benchmark (good)
- **Alpha < 0**: Underperforming benchmark (consider alternatives)
- **Beta < 1**: Less volatile than benchmark
- **Beta > 1**: More volatile than benchmark

---

#### Practical Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Building Core Portfolio**

*Goal*: Select Canadian equity fund for RRSP.

```
1. Check composition:
   → XIC.TO: 250 holdings, top 10 = 38% (well diversified)
   → Sector: Financials 32%, Energy 18%, Tech 8%

2. Check eligibility:
   → Client: $350k, Family: $200k = $550k
   → Qualifies for PREMIUM tier (2.25% → 1.10%)

3. Compare to alternatives:
   → XIU.TO: 60 holdings, top 10 = 65% (concentrated)
   → Overlap with XIC: 78% (very high)
   → Recommendation: Choose one, not both

4. Project fees:
   → $100k investment in PREMIUM tier
   → 25-year savings vs RETAIL: $52,000
```

**Scenario 2: Client Inheritance**

*Goal*: Upgrade existing funds after net worth increase.

```
Client receives $400k inheritance:
- Previous net worth: $280k → Now: $680k
- Holds 4 funds in RETAIL tier

Check upgrade opportunities:
→ Fund A: RETAIL → PREMIUM (save $450/year)
→ Fund B: RETAIL → PREMIUM (save $380/year)
→ Fund C: RETAIL → PREFERRED (save $210/year)
→ Fund D: Already optimal tier

Total annual savings: $1,040
25-year value: ~$44,000 (compounded)

Action: Advisor processes fund code swaps in RRSP (no tax event)
```

**Scenario 3: Portfolio Overlap Audit**

*Goal*: Identify redundant holdings.

```
Client holds:
- XIC.TO (Canadian equity)
- XIU.TO (Canadian equity)
- VCN.TO (Canadian equity)

Check overlaps:
→ XIC + XIU: 82% overlap (very high redundancy)
→ XIC + VCN: 89% overlap (extremely high)
→ XIU + VCN: 85% overlap (very high)

Top 5 holdings appear in all 3 funds:
- RBC, TD, Enbridge, CNR, Brookfield

Recommendation:
- Keep XIC (lowest MER, best diversification)
- Sell XIU + VCN
- Reallocate to US equity or bonds for true diversification
```

**Scenario 4: Fee Impact Analysis**

*Goal*: Show client long-term cost of high-MER fund.

```
Client holds $200k in actively managed mutual fund:
- MER: 2.45%
- Annual fee: $4,900

Compare to low-cost alternatives:
- PREMIUM tier of same fund family: MER 1.15% → $2,300/year
- Broad market ETF: MER 0.15% → $300/year

25-year projection (6% return):
| Option | Final Value | Fees Paid |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Current (2.45%) | $645,000 | $189,000 |
| PREMIUM (1.15%) | $728,000 | $106,000 |
| ETF (0.15%) | $819,000 | $29,000 |

Client savings by switching to PREMIUM: $83,000
Client savings by switching to ETF: $174,000
```

**Scenario 5: Fund vs Benchmark Performance**

*Goal*: Justify active management fee.

```
Analyzing actively managed Canadian equity fund:
→ Fund: ABC Canadian Equity (MER 2.10%)
→ Benchmark: XIC.TO (MER 0.06%)
→ Period: 5 years

Results:
- Fund gross return: 9.2%
- Fund net return (after fees): 7.1%
- Benchmark return: 8.9%
- Alpha: -1.8% (underperformed)

Analysis:
- Fund charged $21,000 in fees over 5 years
- Client would have $18,400 more with benchmark
- Fund did not justify its higher fees

Recommendation:
- Switch to lower-cost option
- Or negotiate for PREMIUM tier (MER 1.20%)
```

---

#### Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Always check client eligibility before recommending funds
- ✅ Use family aggregation when available to access lower MER tiers
- ✅ Review fund overlap when adding new positions
- ✅ Compare fund performance to appropriate benchmark
- ✅ Project long-term fee impact for client
- ✅ Revisit eligibility after client net worth changes
- ✅ Consider tax efficiency (ETF vs Mutual Fund) for non-registered accounts
- ✅ Check holdings concentration (top 10, HHI)

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Assume client qualifies for advertised "low" MER without checking
- ❌ Ignore family net worth when funds allow aggregation
- ❌ Buy multiple funds with >80% overlap
- ❌ Keep high-MER funds when client qualifies for upgrades
- ❌ Compare actively managed fund to wrong benchmark
- ❌ Forget to account for MER when analyzing performance
- ❌ Overlook concentration risk in thematic or sector-specific funds
- ❌ Ignore tracking error for index funds (>1% is poor)

---

#### Integration with Trading Strategies

**Fund Analysis + Sector Analysis**:
```
Check if your funds are overweight certain sectors:
1. Get fund holdings by sector
2. Compare to benchmark sector weights
3. Adjust individual stock positions accordingly
→ Avoid double-weighting sectors
```

**Fund Analysis + Index Benchmarking**:
```
Validate fund performance:
1. Fund tracks S&P 500 → compare to SPY
2. Calculate alpha after fees
3. If alpha < 0 for 3+ years → consider index fund
→ Only pay for active management if it adds value
```

**Example Combined Workflow**:
```
Portfolio review:
1. Client holds XIC.TO (Canadian equity fund)
   → Check holdings: 32% Financials
2. Also holds individual bank stocks: RBC, TD, BNS
   → Check overlap: All 3 are top 10 holdings in XIC
   → Combined weight: 15% of fund + individual positions
3. Compare to S&P/TSX sector weight: Financials = 28%
4. Conclusion: Overweight Financials
5. Action: Reduce individual bank holdings or choose fund with less Financial exposure
```

### Risk Management: Trailing Stops & Profit Taking

**NEW FEATURE**: Lock in profits automatically as your positions gain value.

#### Trailing Stop Loss

**What it is**: A dynamic stop loss that adjusts upward as the price rises, but never moves downward.

**How it works**:
```
1. Buy stock at $100
2. Set 10% trailing stop (trail distance)
3. Set 5% activation threshold
4. Price rises to $106 → Trailing activates
5. Stop is set at $95.40 (10% below $106)
6. Price rises to $120 → Stop moves to $108 (10% below $120)
7. Price falls to $115 → Stop stays at $108
8. Price falls to $108 → Position exits, locking in $8 profit
```

**Benefit**: If price had fallen from $120 back to $90, you'd still exit at $108 instead of losing everything.

#### Partial Profit Taking

**What it is**: Selling portions of your position at predetermined profit levels.

**How it works**:
```
Buy 1000 shares at $10 = $10,000 invested

Price hits $11 (10% gain):
- Sell 25% (250 shares) = $2,750
- Keep 750 shares, locked in $250 profit

Price hits $12 (20% gain):
- Sell 50% of original (500 shares total, but only 750 remain)
- All 750 remaining shares sold = $9,000
- Total proceeds: $2,750 + $9,000 = $11,750
- Total profit: $1,750 (17.5% on original capital)
```

**Benefit**: Lock in guaranteed profits while keeping upside exposure.

#### Configuring Risk Management

**In Backtest Setup**:
```
Dashboard > Backtesting > Advanced Options

[✓] Enable Trailing Stop
    Activation Threshold: 5%  (start trailing after 5% gain)
    Trail Distance: 10%       (stay 10% below highest price)

[✓] Enable Partial Profit Taking
    Level 1: 10% gain → Sell 25%
    Level 2: 20% gain → Sell 50%
    Level 3: 30% gain → Sell remaining
```

**Strategy Combinations**:

**Conservative (Capital Preservation)**:
```
Fixed Stop Loss: 8%
Trailing Stop: 8% distance, activate at 3% gain
Partial Profits: 20% at 5%, 50% at 10%, 100% at 15%
```

**Balanced (Growth + Protection)**:
```
Fixed Stop Loss: 10%
Trailing Stop: 10% distance, activate at 5% gain  
Partial Profits: 25% at 10%, 50% at 20%, 100% at 30%
```

**Aggressive (Let Winners Run)**:
```
Fixed Stop Loss: 15%
Trailing Stop: 15% distance, activate at 10% gain
Partial Profits: 30% at 15%, 100% at 40%
```

**Best Practices**:

✅ **DO**:
- Use trailing stops on momentum strategies (let trends run)
- Use tighter stops (5-8%) on volatile small caps
- Use partial profits to lock in gains on large moves
- Adjust trail distance based on stock volatility
- Test different configurations in backtests

❌ **DON'T**:
- Move stops downward manually (defeats the purpose)
- Use same parameters for all strategies (customize per strategy)
- Ignore trailing stops in range-bound markets (consider fixed stops)
- Take all profit too early (keep some skin in the game)

### Custom Strategy Parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Insufficient Historical Data"

**Problem**: Strategy requires more data than available.

**Solution**:
1. Check minimum required days:
   - Mean Reversion: 100 days
   - Momentum Quality: 250 days
   - Contrarian: 150 days
2. Use a different strategy
3. Choose a stock with more history

#### "Market Data Not Available"

**Problem**: Cannot fetch data for symbol.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Symbol**:
   - Verify correct ticker
   - Some symbols require exchange suffix (e.g., "BRK-B" not "BRKB")

2. **Check Market Hours**:
   - Real-time data only during market hours
   - Use delayed data setting for after-hours

3. **API Rate Limit**:
   - Wait 60 seconds
   - Reduce batch size

#### "Analysis Taking Too Long"

**Problem**: Strategy analysis not completing.

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce Date Range**: Use shorter backtest period
2. **Clear Cache**: Settings > Clear Cache
3. **Check System Resources**: Close other applications
4. **Use Batch Mode**: For multiple symbols

#### "Strategies Showing Conflicting Signals"

**This is NORMAL!**

Different strategies have different goals:
- Mean Reversion: "Buy low, sell high" (short-term)
- Momentum: "Buy high, sell higher" (trend-following)
- Contrarian: "Buy fear" (value-oriented)

**What to do**:
1. Use **Portfolio Analysis** for consensus
2. Consider your **investment timeframe**
3. Check **confidence levels**
4. Review **individual reasoning**

#### "Backtest Results Don't Match Live Trading"

**Common Causes**:
1. **Look-Ahead Bias**: Fixed in system (not your issue)
2. **Slippage**: Real execution differs from backtest
3. **Commission**: Ensure commission settings match broker
4. **Market Conditions**: Past ≠ future
5. **Position Sizing**: Use same size as backtest

**Recommendations**:
- Add 0.1-0.2% extra slippage
- Paper trade first (simulated)
- Start with smaller positions
- Monitor real vs. expected performance

- Your risk tolerance
- Investment timeframe
- Portfolio goals

Recommendation: Use **Portfolio Analysis** with multiple strategies

**Q: Why do strategies disagree?**  
A: Different strategies have different goals:
- Some are short-term, some long-term
- Some favor growth, some favor value
- This diversity is GOOD for portfolio robustness

**Q: Can I combine strategies?**  
A: Yes! That's the point of Portfolio Analysis. Combining strategies usually improves risk-adjusted returns.

**Q: How often should I rebalance?**  
A:

### Sector Analysis Questions

**Q: What is sector analysis and why does it matter?**  
A: Sector analysis compares your stock's performance to its industry peers. It matters because:
- Stock up 20% in sector up 30% = Actually underperforming
- Stock down 5% in sector down 20% = Actually outperforming
- Reveals if gains are company-specific or sector-wide

**Q: What is a good Relative Strength (RS) Ratio?**  
A:
- > 1.5: Significantly outperforming sector (excellent)
- 1.1-1.5: Outperforming sector (good)
- 0.9-1.1: In line with sector (acceptable)
- 0.5-0.9: Underperforming sector (concerning)
- < 0.5: Significantly underperforming (investigate)

**Q: Should I buy a stock that's up 50% this year?**  
A: Check sector context first:
- If sector is up 60%, stock is actually lagging
- If sector is up 10%, stock is a strong outperformer
- Always compare to sector before judging absolute returns

**Q: What is sector rotation?**  
A: When money moves from one sector to another:
- Example: Money rotating from defensive (utilities, staples) to growth (tech, discretionary)
- Signals potential market regime changes
- Use it to rebalance portfolio allocations

**Q: How do I use sector analysis with strategies?**  
A: Combine them:
- Strategy says BUY + Stock outperforming sector = Strong BUY
- Strategy says BUY + Stock underperforming sector = Caution
- Strategy says SELL + Sector rotating down = Strong SELL

### Index Benchmarking Questions

**Q: What is alpha and why does it matter?**  
A: Alpha is excess return beyond what the market delivered:
- Positive alpha = You beat the market
- Negative alpha = You lagged the market
- Zero alpha = You matched the market
Example: Stock up 25%, market up 10%, alpha = +15%

**Q: What is a good beta for my portfolio?**  
A: Depends on risk tolerance:
- Beta 0.8-1.0: Conservative (lower volatility)
- Beta 1.0-1.3: Moderate (market-like volatility)
- Beta 1.3-1.5: Aggressive (higher volatility)
- Beta > 1.5: Very aggressive (expect large swings)

**Q: Which index should I compare my stocks to?**  
A:
- Large-cap stocks → S&P 500 (SPY)
- Small-cap stocks → Russell 2000 (IWM)
- Tech stocks → NASDAQ 100 (QQQ)
- Blue-chip stocks → Dow Jones (DIA)
- Diversified portfolio → Use multiple benchmarks

**Q: What's the difference between alpha and excess return?**  
A: They're related but different:
- Excess Return = Total return - Index return (simple difference)
- Alpha = Return beyond what beta predicted (risk-adjusted)
- Alpha accounts for stock's volatility relative to market

**Q: How do I use correlation in portfolio construction?**  
A:
- High correlation (>0.7): Stocks move together (limited diversification)
- Low correlation (<0.3): Stocks move independently (good diversification)
- Negative correlation (<-0.3): Stocks move opposite (excellent hedge)

**Q: What is tracking error and why does it matter?**  
A: Tracking error measures how much returns deviate from benchmark:
- Low tracking error (<5%): Closely follows index
- Moderate (5-10%): Some independent movement
- High (>10%): Significantly different from index
Use it to gauge if active management is worth the risk.

### Fund Analysis Questions

**Q: What is a MER tier and why does it matter?**  
A: MER (Management Expense Ratio) tier determines the annual fee you pay. Segregated funds often have multiple versions (fund codes) of the same underlying investment:
- RETAIL: 2.0-2.5% MER (no minimum net worth)
- PREFERRED: 1.5-1.9% MER ($250k minimum)
- PREMIUM: 1.0-1.4% MER ($500k minimum)
- INSTITUTIONAL: 0.5-0.9% MER ($1M+ minimum)

Same holdings, different fees. Over 25 years, the difference can exceed $60,000 on a $100k investment.

**Q: How do I know which fund version I qualify for?**  
A: The system checks:
- Your personal net worth
- Your family net worth (if fund allows aggregation)
- Minimum investment amounts
- Whether advisor approval is required

Example: $400k personal + $200k spouse = $600k family net worth → May qualify for PREMIUM tier

**Q: Can I use family net worth to qualify for lower MER tiers?**  
A: Yes, IF the fund allows "family aggregation":
- Some funds allow combining household net worth
- Check fund eligibility rules in system
- Common for segregated funds
- Can unlock significant fee savings

**Q: What is fund overlap and why should I care?**  
A: Fund overlap measures how much two funds hold the same securities:
- <20%: Good diversification
- 20-50%: Acceptable overlap
- 50-80%: High redundancy
- >80%: Very high redundancy—you're essentially paying double fees for same holdings

Example: XIC.TO and XIU.TO have 82% overlap—holding both wastes fees without adding diversification.

**Q: How much in fees will I pay over time?**  
A: Use the MER comparison tool. Example for $100k investment:

| MER | 10-Year Fees | 25-Year Fees |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| 2.25% (RETAIL) | $29,000 | $98,000 |
| 0.75% (INSTITUTIONAL) | $9,800 | $33,500 |

Difference: $19,200 (10Y) or $64,500 (25Y)

**Q: What's the difference between an ETF and segregated fund?**  
A:
- **ETF**: Trades like stock, typically lower fees (0.05-0.75%), no guarantees
- **Segregated Fund**: Insurance product, creditor protection, death benefit guarantees, higher fees (1.0-2.5%), multiple MER tiers

Seg funds often CONTAIN ETFs or mutual funds—you're paying for the insurance wrapper on top.

**Q: Should I pay higher MER for active management?**  
A: Only if the fund consistently delivers positive alpha (outperformance after fees):
- Check 5-year alpha vs benchmark
- If alpha negative → Consider lower-cost index fund
- If alpha positive by >1% → Active management may be justified
- Most actively managed funds underperform after fees

**Q: What is concentration risk in funds?**  
A: When too much weight is in a few holdings:
- **Top 10 holdings >50%**: Significant concentration risk
- **HHI >1,800**: Highly concentrated
- Example: Thematic tech fund with 75% in 10 stocks is risky
- Broad market index funds typically have top 10 <30%

**Q: How often should I check for upgrade opportunities?**  
A: Check eligibility when:
- Client receives inheritance or windfall
- Annual net worth review
- Marriage/divorce (changes family aggregation)
- Job promotion with significant salary increase
- Every 2-3 years at minimum

**Q: Can I switch fund tiers without tax consequences?**  
A: Depends on account type:
- **Registered accounts (RRSP, TFSA)**: Usually no tax consequence—just a fund code swap
- **Non-registered accounts**: May trigger capital gains
- Consult with advisor and tax professional

### Performance Questions

**Q: What is a good Sharpe Ratio?**  
A:
- > 2.0: Excellent
- 1.0-2.0: Good
- 0.5-1.0: Acceptable
- < 0.5: Poor

**Q: What is a good win rate?**  
A:
- > 65%: Excellent
- 55-65%: Good
- 45-55%: Acceptable (if win/loss ratio good)
- < 45%: Needs improvement

**Q: How much drawdown is acceptable?**  
A:
- < 10%: Very conservative
- 10-20%: Moderate
- 20-30%: Aggressive
- > 30%: Very risky

**Q: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results?**  
A: Correct! Backtesting shows historical edge, not future certainty. Always:
- Use risk management
- Diversify
- Size positions appropriately
- Monitor live performance
