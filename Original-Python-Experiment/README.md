# Original ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment

This directory contains the original Python-based trading experiment that served as the foundation for WealthSystem.

## What Was This?

A 6-month live trading experiment where ChatGPT (via AI research and analysis) managed a real-money micro-cap portfolio. The experiment used:

- **Python scripts** for trade execution and portfolio tracking
- **ChatGPT Deep Research** for weekly market analysis and stock recommendations
- **CSV files** for tracking trades and portfolio performance
- **Simple automation** for executing AI-driven trading decisions

## Files Preserved

- `simple_automation.py` - Original automation script
- `trading_script.py` - Core trading logic
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Results.png` - Portfolio performance visualization
- `Experiment Details/` - ChatGPT conversations, prompts, and research
- `Weekly Deep Research (MD)/` - Weekly AI analysis in Markdown
- `Weekly Deep Research (PDF)/` - Weekly AI analysis in PDF
- `Scripts and CSV Files/` - Trade logs and portfolio tracking
- `Start Your Own/` - Guide for replicating the experiment

## Evolution to WealthSystem

The experiment proved that AI-assisted analysis could provide valuable market insights. However, we identified several areas for enhancement:

1. **Professional Architecture** - Moved from scripts to object-oriented PHP
2. **Multiple Strategies** - Expanded from single approach to 6 trading strategies
3. **Fund Management** - Added ETF/mutual fund/seg fund analysis
4. **Client Management** - Built eligibility and net worth tracking
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Added PHPUnit tests for reliability
6. **Advanced Analytics** - Sector analysis, alpha/beta, benchmarking

The core insight remains: **AI can assist in identifying trading opportunities when combined with systematic analysis and risk management.**
