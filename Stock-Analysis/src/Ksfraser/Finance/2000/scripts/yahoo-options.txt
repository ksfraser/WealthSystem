=head2 How can one figure out the format string?  

Provided a My Yahoo! (http://my.yahoo.com) account, go to the
following URL:

    http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_pfview?.vk=v1

Viewing the source of this page, you will come across the section that
defines the menus that let you select which elements go into a
particular view.  The <option> values are the strings that pick up
the information described in the menu item.  For example, Symbol
refers to the string "s" and name refers to the string "l".  Using
"sl" as the format string, we would get the symbol followed by the
name of the security.

The example script I<examine_server.sh> shows this in some more detail
and downloads example .csv files using B<GNU wget>.
