Use limit orders, not market orders.  Ensures a more guaranteed price reducing slip.

In fast moving markets, wait until the price stabilizes before placing the limit order.
Limit orders don't influence the market.
On price bounces (random moves) place the limit at the bottom of the bounce.

Buy strength, Sell Weakness

If a bunch of signals come all at once, buy the strongest market and sell the weakest.  This also considers volume and liquidity.

One way of determining strength is to determing how many N the price has moved since the breakout, and buy the market with the most N.

Another to normalize markets: (Current price - close90) / CurrentN  
Stronger have higher values
