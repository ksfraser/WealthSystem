What market(s) to trade.
Trading too few reduces your odds of getting ahead of a trend
You also don't want to trade markets that have too low a volume.

Trade only very liquid markets (stocks).  Trading in too small liquidity markets
means that any large purchases by yourself drives the price a great deal but the price will 
return to its norms, so you end up paying too much.  Same principle on the sell

Also, trade markets consistently.  If you aren't going to trade oil company shares,
then NEVER trade oil company shares.  Inconsistency hurts in the long run as you
end up trading on emotion rather than on your system.
