Often, two or more of these forms of indicators will be combined in the creation of a rule. For example, the MA crossover system uses two moving average parameters, the long-term and the short-term, to create a rule: "buy when the short-term crosses above the long term, and sell when the opposite is true." In other cases, a rule uses only one indicator. For example, a system might have a rule that forbids any buying unless the relative strength is above a certain level. But it is a combination of all these kinds of rules that makes a trading system.
