In a long position the gains are "automatically" reinvested since the
initial sum and the gains are on the market. With a short position this
is no more true. 

This CloseStrategy tries to defeat this by reinvesting the gains each time
a certain amount of gain has been made since last time the position was
augmented.

Use this CloseStrategy at the end of the "system chain" so that a position
is not augmented if it's planned to be closed.
