Entry is deciding when to get into the trade

The turtles used a very simple system:
they traded either 1, 2, or 50% 1 + 50% 2:
1 - 20 day breakout
2 - 55 day breakout.

BREAKOUT:
The price exceeding the high or low of a particular number of days.  Thus the 20 day breakout is when the price is now higher than the HIGH of the last 20 days.

When the price exceeded the breakout by 1 tick, they bought 1 unit.  Similarily when the price fell 1 tick below the low, they sold 1 unit.

System 1

For the 20 day system, the signal was ignored if the last breakout would have resulted in a winning trade (appears they had a fixed 10 day sale).  It didn't matter if the previous breakout was taken or skipped, nor the direction of the breakout.  The breakout was considered a LOSING trade if it moved 2N against the position before the 10 day exit.  Because of this skip, the *fallback* breakout point is now the 55 day, for this 1 time only to ensure a major move isn't missed out on.

If you are out of the market, there will always be a price which triggers a short and another higher price which triggers a long.  If the breakout was a loser, the entry would be closer to the current price (i.e. 20 day) then had it been a winner in which case the entry signal was farther away (i.e. 55 day).

System 2

If a 55 day breakout occurs, take the appropriate buy/sell action.

ADDING TO A POSITION
If the price moves 1/2N past the breakout, add a unit.  This 1/2N interval is based upon the fill price of the previous order.  If the price slips 1/2N, then the new fill price is 1N above the breakout price. This continues up to the Unit Maximum rule.

i.e.
N = 2.50
55 day breakout = 310

1st	2nd	3rd	4th
310	311.25	312.5	313.75
