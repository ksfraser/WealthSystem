AST Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Automatic Installation

   On most systems AST can be installed by running install.pl. You must 
install gnuplot separately. install.pl will modify your crontab and apache
configuration.

2. Manual Installation

   If install.pl doesn't work with your system (e.g. you are not running
apache, or on a host without shell access) then you probably want to do the 
manual installation. The first thing you need to do is locate your web root.
Here is a list of common webroots:

DISTRIBUTION		WEB ROOT
Gentoo Linux		/var/www/localhost/htdocs
SUSE Linux 9, 10	/srv/www/htdocs
Ubuntu, Debian		/var/www
Fedora, Red Hat		/var/www/html

You can also use the cgi-bin in your home directory (~/public_html/cgi-bin).
 If you are using a hosting provider, you will want to use your cgi-bin 
directory.

Once you have determined your web root, copy all files from the AST tarball 
into a directory in your webroot.

mkdir -p /var/www/localhost/htdocs/ast
cp -R * /var/www/localhost/htdocs/ast/

You need to make AST setuid some user, because it will be run by many different
users and the files need to be compatible with each other. Using your web 
server user id is probably the best way to do it. If you are using apache, 
you can find this in the configuration file, the settings User and Group. If 
you are using your public_html directory this is already done for you.

cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/ast
chown apache:apache ast
chmod 6755 ast

Finally you need to make your new directory able to execute CGI scripts. If 
you are using apache, you should add this to your configuration file:

<Directory "/var/www/localhost/htdocs/ast">
    AllowOverride All
    Options ExecCGI
    SetHandler cgi-script
    DirectoryIndex ast
</Directory>

To make these settings take effect, you must restart the web server:

/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

The last thing you need to do is load up the crontab file which will execute scheduled events:

crontab /var/www/localhost/htdocs/ast/share/example/crontab

Make sure to merge these files if you already have something in your crontab!

Enjoy!
