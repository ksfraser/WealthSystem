Adding new markets 
	 	 
Describes the steps to create a new market in AST. By default AST comes setup for North American markets. 
However you can configure AST to use any market. AST may already have the market you want, but it may be 
disabled. First start by going into the Setup menu and selecting markets. If you see the market you want, 
but it has a line through it, then click the eraser to enable that market. This is all you need to do.

If you don't see the market you are looking for, press the Add Market button. Enter a short name, such as 
TSX, for the market in the Market ID field. This can be whatever you like. The next thing we need to do 
is determine the market key. This is the suffix Yahoo uses for the market. You can lookup the market on 
http://finance.yahoo.com/exchanges. You can leave the the Globe Investor suffix blank as it applies to 
North American markets only. BigCharts suffix is currently not used, so also leave that blank. In market 
symbol, you should enter Yahoo's ticker symbol for your market index. This is used by some parts of AST 
that compare stocks vs. the market they are in. There is no good page to look this up on, you have to 
hunt around the Yahoo Finance website. You can leave it blank if you can't find it.

The last thing you need is a symbol list. This is used for features like reports and pattern search, so 
it is important. You can usually find this information on the exchange's website. You want to place the 
symbol list in the share/symbols directory. It should be a text file in the format . You need to create 
the symbol list before going into the add market screen, otherwise you won't see the file in the dropdown.

If you add a new market, please send me the details so that I can add it to the default setup for other 
users.
