@caption Volatility
The volatility metric measures the expected intra-period variation of a stock's value as a percentage gain. For example, a stock with a daily volatility of 2 % means that typically the difference between the low on day 1 and the high on day 2 is roughly 2 %. Stocks that have a high volatility typically make large moves in a single day.<br>
