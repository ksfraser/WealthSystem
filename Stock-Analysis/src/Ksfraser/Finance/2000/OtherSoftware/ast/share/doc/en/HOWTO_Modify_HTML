While ast is writen in C++, it doesn't take any C++ knowledge for modify a 
form, stylesheet, javascript or most any HTML output from ast. AST uses a 
system of templates, which are stored in the share/templates directory. These 
templates have parameters which start with $. When you request a form, ast 
loads up the template and replaces all $ parameters with thier values. If 
you try to use a parameter which ast does not know about you will get an 
error. If you need to use a dollar sign in the template, you should use 
its HTML code: &#36;. The file names typically start with the process they 
are used by. You can find this in the url of the page you want to modify, 
it will say process=worksheet for example. Then you can find the form used 
by the worksheet in the file share/templates/worksheet-edit.

If you want to modify the style, you can find the stylesheets in share/style. 
If you create a new stylesheet in this directory, ast will give the user the 
option to select your new stylesheet in the User Preferences screen. For this 
to work the stylesheet must end with .css.

If you want to add javascript, you can modify the existing scripts in 
share/script or add your own. You should use the javascript process to 
return the javascript as this will pass it through the template parser.

All of the images used by ast can be found in the images directory.

If you have any questions about how to make further modifications or have a 
problem with this document please contact me. Also if you would like to get 
your modifications into the default ast distribution, please send me a patch. 
I am always looking for talented web designers to improve the interface.
