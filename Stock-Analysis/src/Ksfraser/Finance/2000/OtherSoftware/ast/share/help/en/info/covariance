@caption Covariance
Covariance is a statistical measure of the likely hood of two securities to yield the same returns. If two securities have a high, positive covariance then they typically yield the same returns on a given day. If two securities have a covariance near 0, then their returns are independent of each other. If two securities have a negative covariance, then they typically move in opposite directions. A portfolio that contains a lot of highly correlated (high covariance) securities is not well diversified and is susceptible to market moves.<br>
