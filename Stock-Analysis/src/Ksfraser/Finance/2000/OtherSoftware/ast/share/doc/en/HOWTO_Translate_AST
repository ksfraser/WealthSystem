1. Introduction
AST 0.2.1 and newer support translation. If you are planning on translating 
AST please contact me first, so I can let you know if anyone else is working 
on the same translation. This document you will assume you are translating 
the language code xx for country YY. The country code is optional and often 
omitted. AST does not yet support localization, so the country code will not 
be used.

2. Getting Started
The first thing we need to do is setup all of the directories. First, add a 
line to etc/languages for the language we are translating. It should be 
something like:

xx Example Language

Next, create copies of the English templates, defaults and help directories:

	cd share/templates
	cp -R en xx
	cd ../defaults
	cp -R en xx
	cd ../help
	cp -R en xx

Finally, we need to create the messages directory for the language and copy 
the messages template:

	mkdir -p share/messages/xx/LC_MESSAGES
	cp src/po/ast.pot src/po/xx.po

2. What to Translate
The templates directory contains only HTML files. All of the English in these 
files should be translated. Please do not translate field name, tags, etc. The 
defaults directory contains data that is loaded into AST by default when the 
application is installed. If you are translating this information, you will 
not see any changes because the English data has already been loaded for you. 
You will need to delete your var/data directory, which will cause AST to 
reload the default data in the correct language. The format of these files is:

field-name: field-value
...
# comment
%% # <-- record separator

You should only translate the field values. For some files, such as currencies,
do not translate the currency code such as USD. Here is an example, the 
portfolios defaults:

portfolios.flags: 0
portfolios.id: 0
portfolios.name: Default Portfolio
portfolios.description: AST Default Portfolio
%%

The translated file may look like (a babelfish French translation): 

portfolios.flags: 0
portfolios.id: 0
portfolios.name: Brochure De Défaut
portfolios.description: AST Brochure De Défaut
%%

The files in share/help also need to be translated. The format of these files 
is mostly pain text. There are some directives, which are lines that start 
with @word. You should translate every except for words starting with @. An 
example file is (share/help/en/tooltip/chart):

@caption Chart
Draws a chart of the historical prices for this security.

The babelfish French translation would be:

@caption Diagramme
Trace un diagramme des prix historiques de cette sécurité.

The last thing you need to translation is the gettext message database. You 
can read the gettext manual if you need more information on gettext. This is 
the file src/po/xx.po. You can use a graphical tool such as KBabel to 
translate this file. To compile and install it for testing, you should do:

cd src/po
./buildlang.sh xx

3. What to send

When you have completed the translation, please send me all of the transated 
files so that I can add them to the distribution for other users. The files 
you should send are:
1. The share/templates/xx directory
2. The share/help/xx directory
3. The share/defaults/xx directory
4. The file src/po/xx.po

Your translation efforts are appreciated. Thanks!
