# A test file for tsinvestsim(1), of a deteriorating market with 300
# equities, simulating the US equity markets for 3,254 trading days
# between 15 August, 1921, and 6 June, 1932, inclusive. During the 2,401
# trading day period between 15 August, 1921 and 7 September, 1929, the
# US equity markets had a substantial gain of about 5.7X in value, (DJIA
# values of 66.02 to 375.44.) During the 853 trading day period between
# 7 September, 1929, and 6 June, 1932, the markets had a significant
# reversal, loosing about 90% of their 7 September, 1929 value, (DJIA
# values of 375.44 to 42.68,) for about a 30% loss on the decade
# 1921-1931, and did not regain their 7 September, 1929 values until mid
# 1956.
#
# This file is intended to test how well the tsinvest(1) program does in
# adverse market conditions.
#
# To make the tsinvest(1) data file, tsinvestsim(1) is executed twice-the
# first time on this file, which is when the market was increasing:
#
#    tsinvestsim crash-up.data 2401 | sed 's/^/UP/' > crash.data
#
# with the terminal values for each stock at the end of the simulation
# used to make another tsinvestsim(1) input file with the same initial
# values, which is when the market was decreasing:
#
#    egrep '^UP2400' crash.data | cut -f2,3 | sed 's/   /, p = 0.44, f = 0.02, h = 0.55, i = /' > crash-down.data
#
# (where sed(1) is replacing a tab character,) which is then executed by
# tsinvestsim(1):
#
#    tsinvestsim crash-down.data 853 | sed 's/^/DOWN/' >> crash.data
#
# and, to exercise this file:
#
#    tsinvest -i -t -s -c crash.data
#
# where the -d 1|2|3|4|5|6 argument of tsinvest(1) is used to alter the
# wagering strategy.
