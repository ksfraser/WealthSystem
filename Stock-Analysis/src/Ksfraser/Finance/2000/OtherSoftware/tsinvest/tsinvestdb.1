.SH DESCRIPTION

Tsinvestdb.c is a C source code template for programs that manipulate
the tsinvest(1) time series database(s). It contains the hash
algorithm look up tables for expedient development of specialized
database systems.

The time series database file structure is a text file consisting of
records, in temporal order, one record per time series sample of each
equity.  Blank records are ignored, and comment records are signified
by a '#' character as the first non white space character in the
record. Each data record represents an equity transaction, consisting
of a minium of three fields, separated by white space. The fields are
ordered by time stamp, equity ticker identifier, and closing price,
for example:

    1      ABC     333.6
    2      DEF     7.2
    3      GHI     335.9
