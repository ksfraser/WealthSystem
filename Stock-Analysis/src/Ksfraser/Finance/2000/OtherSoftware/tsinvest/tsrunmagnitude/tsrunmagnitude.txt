NAME
       tsrunmagnitude - find the magnitude of the run lengths in a time series

SYNOPSIS
       tsrunmagnitude [-r r] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsrunmagnitude is for finding the magnitude of the  run	lengths  in  a
       time series. The value of each sample in the time series is stored, and
       subtracted from all other values in the time series, each  point  being
       tallied root mean square. The magnitude deviation is printed to stdout.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per	time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#'  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain	many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple's value at that time.

OPTIONS
       -r r   The root to be used for the root mean, (0.5).

       -v     Print the version and copyright banner of the program.

WARNINGS
       There is little or no provision for handling numerical exceptions.
