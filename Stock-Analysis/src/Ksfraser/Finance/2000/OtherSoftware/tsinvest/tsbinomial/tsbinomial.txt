NAME
       tsbinomial - generate a binomial distribution time series

SYNOPSIS
       tsbinomial [-f fraction] [-i value] [-n n] [-p probability]
		  [-r] [-s] [-t] [-v] number

DESCRIPTION
       Tsbinomial  is  for generating binomial distribution noise, with unfair
       bias, and cumulative sum-generates a time series.  The idea is to  pro-
       duce  a 1/f squared power spectrum distribution by running a cumulative
       sum on a binomial distribution. The program accepts a  an  unfair  bias
       and a wager factor. See "Fractals," Jens Feder, Plenum Press, New York,
       New York, 1988, ISBN 0-306-42851-2, pp. 154, as suggested by Hurst.

       This program is a modification of the program tscoin. The  wager  frac-
       tion  is  computed by first calculating the optimal wager fraction, f =
       2P - 1, where P is the Shannon probability, and f is the optimal  wager
       fraction,  (which  is  the root mean square = standard deviation of the
       normalized increments of the time series,) and then reducing this value
       by  the	standard  deviation of the binomial distribution, which is the
       square root of the number of elements in  the  distribution,  ie.,  the
       root  mean square of the normalized increments of the cumulative sum is
       the same as the standard deviation of the binomial  distribution.   See
       "Fractals,"  Jens  Feder,  Plenum Press, New York, New York, 1988, ISBN
       0-306-42851-2, pp. 155.

       Note: these programs use the following functions from other references:

	   ran1, which returns a uniform random deviate between
	   0.0 and 1.0. See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of
	   Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian
	   P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,
	   Cambridge University Press, New York, 1988, ISBN
	   0-521-35465-X, page 210, referencing Knuth.

	   gasdev, which returns a normally distributed deviate
	   with zero mean and unit variance, using ran1 () as the
	   source of uniform deviates. See "Numerical Recipes in
	   C: The Art of Scientific Computing," William H. Press,
	   Brian P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William
	   T. Vetterling, Cambridge University Press, New York,
	   1988, ISBN 0-521-35465-X, page 217.

	   gammln, which returns the log of the results of the
	   gamma function.  See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art
	   of Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian
	   P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,
	   Cambridge University Press, New York, 1988, ISBN
	   0-521-35465-X, page 168.

OPTIONS
       -f fraction
	      Fraction of reserves to be wagered, (0 <= fraction <= 1)

       -i value
	      Initial value of cash reserves

       -n n   Number of elements in the binomial distribution.

       -p probability
	      Shannon probability, (0.5 <= probability <= 1.0)

       -r     Do not normalize the standard deviation = fraction.

       -s     Print  the  cumulative  sum  of  the  binomial distribution time
	      series.

       -t     Sample's time will be included in the output time series.

       -v     Print the version and copyright banner of the program.

       number Number of data points in the output time series.

WARNINGS
       There is little or no provision for handling numerical exceptions.
