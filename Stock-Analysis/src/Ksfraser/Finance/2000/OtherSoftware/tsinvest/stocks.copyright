Subject: Old MIT server data
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 1997 14:13:59 -0800

Hi Mark.

I wrote an entropic analysis program for equities, and reformatted
the data from the old MIT server as a demo, and want to place the
sources to the program in public domain. Can I include my
re-formatted data from the old server in the program distribution?
(I am concerned about copyright restrictions of the ticker data.)

        Thanks for any information,

        John

Yes, you can do this.  Copyright protection for reformatted historical
stock data is murky at best, and the MIT data came from a source who
claimed he was placing it in the public domain.
