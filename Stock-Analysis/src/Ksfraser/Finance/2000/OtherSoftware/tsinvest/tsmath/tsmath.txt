NAME
       tsmath - mathamatical operations on a time series

SYNOPSIS
       tsmath  [-a n] [-b] [-d n] [-e] [-l] [-L] [-M] [-m n]
	       [-p n] [-R] [-S] [-s n] [-t] [-v] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsmath  for  for  performing arithmetic operations on each element in a
       time series. The resultant time series is printed to stdio.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per	time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#'  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain	many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple's value at that time.

OPTIONS
       -a n   Add the number n to each element in the time series.

       -b     Take the absolute value of each element in the time series.

       -d n   Divide each element in the time series by the number n.

       -e     Exponentiate each element in the time series.

       -l     Take the logarithm of each element in the time series.

       -L     Find the minimum value in the time series.

       -M     Find the maximum value in the time series.

       -m n   Multiply each element in the time series by the number n.

       -p n   Raise each element in the time series to the power n.

       -R     Take the square root of each element in the time series.

       -S     Square each element in the time series.

       -s n   Subtract the number n from each element in the time series.

       -t     Sample's time will be included in the output time series.

       -v     Print the version and copyright banner of the program.

       filename
	      Input filename.

WARNINGS
       There is little or no provision for handling numerical exceptions.
