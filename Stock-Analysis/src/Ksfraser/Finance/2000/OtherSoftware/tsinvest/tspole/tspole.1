.SH NAME
tspole \- single pole filter a time series
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
tspole [-p n] [-t] [-v] [filename]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Tspole is for single pole low pass filtering of a time series. The
single pole low pass filter is implemented from the following discrete
time equation:

    v      = I * k2 + v  * k1
     n + 1             n

where I is the value of the current sample in the time series, v are the
value of the output time series, and k1 and k2 are constants determined
from the following equations:

          -2 * p * pi
    k1 = e

and

    k2 = 1 - k1

where p is a constant that determines the frequency of the pole-a value
of unity, the default, places the pole at the sample frequency of the
time series.

The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in
temporal order, one record per time series sample.  Blank records are
ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#' character as the
first non white space character in the record. Data records must
contain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but
may contain many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the
first field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as
the sample's value at that time.

This program is based on "An Analog, Discrete Time, Single Pole Filter,"
John Conover, Fairchild Journal of Semiconductor Progress, July/August,
1978, Volume 6, Number 4, pp. 11.
