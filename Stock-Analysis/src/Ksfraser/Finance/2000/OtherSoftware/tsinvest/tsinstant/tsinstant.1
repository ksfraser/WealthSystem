.SH DESCRIPTION
Tsinstant is for finding the instantaneous fraction of
change in a time series. The value of a sample in the time
series is subtracted from the previous sample in the time
series, and divided by the value of the previous
sample. For Brownian motion, random walk fractals, the
absolute value of the instantaneous fraction of change is
also the root mean square of the instantaneous fraction of
change, (the absolute value of the normalized increments,
when averaged, is related to the root mean square of the
increments by a constant. If the normalized increments are
a fixed increment, the constant is unity. If the
normalized increments have a Gaussian distribution, the
constant is ~0.8 depending on the accuracy of of "fit" to
a Gaussian distribution). Squaring this value is the
average of the instantaneous fraction of change, and
adding unity to the absolute value of the instantaneous
fraction of change, and dividing by two, is the Shannon
probability of the instantaneous fraction of change. The
values are printed to stdout.

For fractional Brownian motion time series, substantial
filtering will be required of the output time series. The
programs tspole(1) and tsavgwindow(1) may be used, perhaps
in a cascade fashion, to implement a filtering technique,
which potentially could be used in an adaptive
computational system. Markov techniques may also be
applicable. Note that in fractal time series, the short
term correlation, say less than three time units as a
typical value, is quite high-this can be verified by the
tshurst(1) program, eg., filtering, to find the average
value, over a few time units, may be an advantageous
strategy in adaptive computational control systems.

The input file structure is a text file consisting of
records, in temporal order, one record per time series
sample.  Blank records are ignored, and comment records
are signified by a '#' character as the first non white
space character in the record. Data records must contain
at least one field, which is the data value of the sample,
but may contain many fields-if the record contains many
fields, then the first field is regarded as the sample's
time, and the last field as the sample's value at that
time.
