NAME
       tsgainwindow - find the windowed gain of a time series

SYNOPSIS
       tsgainwindow [-t] [-w size] [-v] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsgainwindow  is  for  finding the windowed gain of a time series.  The
       value of a sample in the time series added to the cumulative sum of the
       samples, and is squared and added to the cumulative sum of squares, the
       Shannon probability, P, calculated using:

	       avg
	       --- + 1
	       rms
	   P = -------
		  2

       where rms is the root mean square of the marginal returns, and  avg  is
       the average of the marginal returns, and the gain, G, calculated using:

			P	     P - 1
	   G = (1 + rms)  * (1 - rms)

       to make a new time series. The new time series is printed to stdout.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per	time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#'  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain	many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple's value at that time.

OPTIONS
       -t     Sample's time will be included in the output time series.

       -w size
	      Specifies the window size for the running average.

       -v     Print the version and copyright banner of the program.

       filename
	      Input filename.

WARNINGS
       There is little or no provision for handling numerical exceptions.
