.SH DESCRIPTION
Tsrunlength is for finding the run lengths of zero free intervals in
a time series, which is assumed to be a Brownian fractal.  The value
of each sample in the time series is stored, and the run length to a
like value in the time series is stored. A histogram of the number of
run lengths of each run length value is printed to stdout as tab
delimited columns of run length value, positive run lengths, negative
run lengths, and the sum of both positive and negative run lengths,
followed by the cumulative sum of the positive run lengths, the
cumulative sum of negative run lengths, and the cumulative sum of both
positive and negative run lengths.

The idea is to create a run length structure, that tallies how many
time intervals a run length was either positive or negative, for each
element in the time series. When a run length transition is made,
(ie., when the value of the time series has PASSED through the value
of the time series when the run length structure was created, from a
positive or negative direction,) then the run length is tallied into
histogram arrays, and the structure removed. See "Fractals, Chaos,
Power Laws," Manfred Schroeder, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York,
New York, 1991, ISBN 0-7167-2136-8, pp 160.

As approximations for the probability, p, of the run lengths, for t >>
1, p = 1 / (2 * x^(3/2)), which can be integrated for the cumulative
probability, P, for t >> 1, P = 1 / sqrt (t). For t ~ 1, P = erf (1 /
sqrt (t).

Note: there is an issue with this methodology-a run length is not
considered complete until the value is PASSED, so, for example, a
square wave function input will never be tallied, ie., a 1 to -1 to 1
to -1 to 2 sequence is a negative run length of 3 time units.

The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in
temporal order, one record per time series sample.  Blank records are
ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#' character as the
first non white space character in the record. Data records must
contain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but
may contain many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the
first field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as
the sample's value at that time.
