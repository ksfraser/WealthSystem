       Tsrunlength is for finding the run lengths of zero free intervals in  a
       time  series,  which is assumed to be a Brownian fractal.  The value of
       each sample in the time series is stored, and the run length to a  like
       value  in  the  time series is stored. A histogram of the number of run
       lengths of each run length value is printed to stdout as tab  delimited
       columns  of  run  length  value,  positive  run  lengths,  negative run
       lengths, and the sum of both positive and negative  run  lengths,  fol-
       lowed by the cumulative sum of the positive run lengths, the cumulative
       sum of negative run lengths, and the cumulative sum  of  both  positive
       and negative run lengths.

       The  idea  is  to  create a run length structure, that tallies how many
       time intervals a run length was either positive or negative,  for  each
       element in the time series. When a run length transition is made, (ie.,
       when the value of the time series has PASSED through the value  of  the
       time  series when the run length structure was created, from a positive
       or negative direction,) then the run length is tallied  into  histogram
       arrays,  and  the structure removed. See "Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws,"
       Manfred Schroeder, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, New York, 1991,
       ISBN 0-7167-2136-8, pp 160.

       As  approximations for the probability, p, of the run lengths, for t >>
       1, p = 1 / (2 * x^(3/2)), which can be integrated  for  the  cumulative
       probability,  P,  for t >> 1, P = 1 / sqrt (t). For t ~ 1, P = erf (1 /
       sqrt (t).

       Note: there is an issue with this methodology-a run length is not  con-
       sidered  complete  until the value is PASSED, so, for example, a square
       wave function input will never be tallied, ie., a 1 to -1 to 1 to -1 to
       2 sequence is a negative run length of 3 time units.

       The  input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in tem-
       poral order, one record per time  series  sample.   Blank  records  are
       ignored,  and  comment  records are signified by a '#' character as the
       first non white space character in the record. Data records  must  con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the  first
       field  is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the sam-
       ple's value at that time.
