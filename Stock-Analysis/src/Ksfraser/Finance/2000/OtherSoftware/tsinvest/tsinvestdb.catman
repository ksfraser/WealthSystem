       Tsinvestdb.c  is  a C source code template for programs that manipulate
       the tsinvest(1) time series database(s). It contains the hash algorithm
       look  up  tables for expedient development of specialized database sys-
       tems.

       The time series database file structure is a text  file  consisting  of
       records,  in  temporal order, one record per time series sample of each
       equity.  Blank records are ignored, and comment records  are  signified
       by  a  ’#’  character  as  the  first  non white space character in the
       record. Each data record represents an equity  transaction,  consisting
       of  a  minium of three fields, separated by white space. The fields are
       ordered by time stamp, equity ticker identifier, and closing price, for
       example:

           1      ABC     333.6
           2      DEF     7.2
           3      GHI     335.9
