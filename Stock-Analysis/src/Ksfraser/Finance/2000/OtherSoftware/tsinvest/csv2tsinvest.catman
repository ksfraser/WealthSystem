       Csv2tsinvest.c is a C source code template for  programs  that  convert
       different  time  series  formats and structures to the tsinvest(1) time
       series database(s) format.

       The example application is the Yahoo! historical stock  price  database
       spreadsheet  format,  csv,  available  from http://chart.yahoo.com/d by
       specifying "Download Spreadsheet Format" at the bottom of the page when
       requesting the time series for a stock. For example, the csv format for
       ticker symbol GE looks like:

           Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
           26-Oct-99,125.9375,127.25,124.9375,125.625,6226400
           25-Oct-99,124.625,125.9375,123.625,125.25,4565300
           22-Oct-99,123.50,126.1875,123.4375,125.625,5705400
           .
           .
           .
           6-Jan-70,0.8956,0.8956,0.8662,0.8706,35500
           5-Jan-70,0.9015,0.9059,0.8897,0.8971,42400
           2-Jan-70,0.9118,0.9133,0.90,0.9015,23200

       Which needs to be converted to the tsinvest(1) database format.

       The tsinvest(1) time series database file structure is a text file con-
       sisting  of records, in temporal order, one record per time series sam-
       ple of each equity.  Blank records are ignored, and comment records are
       signified  by a ’#’ character as the first non white space character in
       the record. Each data record represents an equity transaction, consist-
       ing  of  a minium of three fields, separated by white space. The fields
       are ordered by time stamp, equity ticker identifier, and closing price,
       for example:

           1      ABC     333.6
           2      DEF     7.2
           3      GHI     335.9

       There are certain advantages to imposing additional structural require-
       ments on the tsinvest(1) time series database file structure. For exam-
       ple,  although  tsinvest(1)  places no constraints on white space field
       delimiters, if the multiple  consecutive  white  space  characters  are
       required to be exactly a single tab character, the time series database
       becomes  a  "Unix  standard"  tab  delimited  tabular  text  relational
       database,  and  can  be manipulated with the traditional Unix commands,
       sed(1), awk(1), cut(1), paste(1), etc.

       Additionally, although tsinvest(1) places no context or meaning on  the
       time stamp in the first field, if the time stamp values are required to
       be lexical on the temporal order, databases of individual stocks can be
       combined into a market by concatenating the files of individual stocks,
       and then sorting on the first field with the traditional Unix commands,
       cat(1), and sort(1). For example:

           cat stock1.file ... stockn.file | sort > market.file

       There  are, obviously, many alternatives for importing stock price time
       series into the tsinvest(1) suite:

           1) The Unix standard tab delimited tabular text
           relational database is a very extensible universal
           file structure, and a significant infrastructure
           exists for translating and manipulating such files
           with programs like perl(1), sed(1), awk(1), cut(1),
           paste(1), etc., which can be used in shell script
           programs.

           2) The sources, in main (), of tsinvest(1) can be
           modified to accommodate some file
           structures. Frequently, all that has to be changed are
           the field number implicit addresses, and perhaps the
           field delimiter, since the field sequence, (time
           stamp, symbol name, price,) is fairly
           standard-although intermixed with other data, such as
           open, high, low, and volume.

           3) A separate program can be written, in a compiled
           language, to do the translation from one file format
           to another.
