.SH DESCRIPTION
tsmarket is for market simulation by fractional brownian
noise generation, with unfair bias, and cumulative
sum-generates a time series.  The idea is to produce a 1/f
squared power spectrum distribution for each company in an
industrial market by running a cumulative sum on a
Gaussian power spectrum distribution. The aggregate of all
companies participating in the market is obtained by
summing the production of the individual companies.  The
program accepts an unfair bias and a wager factor, and the
number of companies in the market.  See "Fractals", Jens
Feder, Plenum Press, New York, New York, 1988, ISBN
0-306-42851-2, pp 172.

As an example, consider the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA,) historical time series data for the
integrated circuit marketplace in North America:

    From the program tsshannonwindow, the Shannon
    probability, P = 0.758207.

    From the programs tsfraction and tsrms, the root mean
    square value of the normalized increments, rms =
    0.087396.

    From the programs tsfraction and tsavg, the average of
    the normalized increments, avg = 0.045132.

Interestingly, the optimal rms value would be rms = 2P - 1
= 0.516414, if the SIA time series could be represented a
Brownian fractal, (ie., represented as a gambler's capital
time series in an unfair coin toss game. See "Fractals,
Chaos, Power Laws," Manfred Schroeder, W. H. Freeman and
Company, New York, New York, 1991, ISBN 0-7167-2136-8, pp
128.)

For this analysis, it is assumed that:

    1) Each company acts independently, and will receive
    cash flow from the market.

    2) Some of this cash flow will be diverted into new
    product manufacturing, development, etc., which in
    turn will go back into the market, which in turn will
    create cash flow, and so on-but there is a random
    element in this process.

    3) Analysis of the SIA graph yields that it is
    probably a fractal, (fractional Brownian variety,)
    with a fairly accurate distribution of the normalized
    increments that appears to be Gaussian in nature, a
    range that appears to increase with the square root of
    time, and an exponential curvature. These are
    indicative of system that can be modeled by as a
    gambler's capital in an unfair coin toss game, or
    Brownian fractal.

To analyze the SIA time series, it is interesting to note
that the avg is 0.045132, which would be the sum total of
the average of all companies in the market. If the
individual companies are assumed to be operating
optimally, (and all identical,) then the rms would be the
square root of the avg, which is 0.212442934.  This would
be the amount "wagered" in each iteration of the unfair
coin game, (which is a Brownian fractal,) and the Shannon
probability would be 0.212442934 = 2P - 1, or P =
0.606221467.

Using the program tsmarket:

    tsmarket -p 0.6 -c n 2500 > data

The variable n was altered to approximate the statistical
data of the SIA numbers. The best seems to be with n = 5:

    from tsshannonwindow, P = 0.744495
    from tsfraction and tsrms, rms = 0.102880
    from tsfraction and tsavg, avg = 0.050307

which compares favorably, to about +/- 5%, with the
original SIA numbers:

    from tsshannonwindow, P = 0.758207
    from tsfraction and tsrms, rms = 0.087396
    from tsfraction and tsavg, avg = 0.045132

which would tend to indicate that the constituent
companies in the aggregate are operating optimally, and
that the measurements on the aggregate sum of the market,
ie., the SIA numbers, would indicate a higher Shannon
probability, P, and a smaller root mean square value of
the normalized increments, rms.

The reason is as follows:

    1) Consider a market that is supplied by a single
    company. The time series for the market could be
    represented, at least statistically, as an unfair coin
    tossing game, (see tscoins(1),) with each time unit of
    manufacturing going into the marketplace, the
    marketplace returning cash to the company's P & L,
    which is distributed to the company's operations to
    manufacture more product, and so on. But there is an
    element of randomness in this process that represents
    the aggregate of customer desires and market
    forces-this is assumed be a central limit phenomena,
    ie., it can be represented as a random variable with a
    normal, (Gaussian,) distribution. Note, that like the
    gambler, the company's operations managers are
    continually wagering on the future-and each wager may,
    or may not prove to be a successful.  It is further
    assumed that the company will commit capital to
    enhancing its market position, (ie., increase
    manufacturing capacity, develop new products, etc.,)
    and, as above, the decision to do so will contain an
    element of risk, and will sometimes work out, and
    sometimes not.

    2) Now consider that another company decides to
    participate in the marketplace-under the same scenario
    of 1), above. If everything else is equal, we would
    expect the market, eventually, to be divided equally
    between the two companies, or each company would have
    half the market.  When the second company was added to
    the market, the first company's contribution to the
    marketplace was cut in half-and its root mean square
    value of its normalized increments contribution to the
    marketplace was also cut in half. The second company's
    contribution to the marketplace is the remaining one
    half, and its contribution to the root mean square
    value of its normalized increments is the same as the
    first company's. (The point is that the contributions
    to the marketplace add linearly, but the contribution
    of to the normalized increments of the marketplace add
    root mean square-so we would expect the root mean
    square value of the normalized increments to decrease
    when the number of participants in the marketplace
    changes from one to two-since the value of the
    normalized increments for each company is proportional
    to the contribution to its the market.)  Think of it
    as a Gaussian noise generator. If we cut the root mean
    square value (amplitude,) of the noise generator in
    one half, and add an identical noise generator, the
    resulting noise output of both generators will be the
    square root of two, divided by two.

    3) Or in general, the root mean square value of the
    normalized increments of a marketplace time series
    will be proportional to one over the square root of
    the number of companies in the market.

Note: these programs use the following functions from
other references:

    ran1, which returns a uniform random deviate between
    0.0 and 1.0. See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of
    Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian
    P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,
    Cambridge University Press, New York, 1988, ISBN
    0-521-35465-X, page 210, referencing Knuth.

    gasdev, which returns a normally distributed deviate
    with zero mean and unit variance, using ran1 () as the
    source of uniform deviates. See "Numerical Recipes in
    C: The Art of Scientific Computing," William H. Press,
    Brian P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William
    T. Vetterling, Cambridge University Press, New York,
    1988, ISBN 0-521-35465-X, page 217.

    gammln, which returns the log of the results of the
    gamma function.  See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art
    of Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian
    P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,
    Cambridge University Press, New York, 1988, ISBN
    0-521-35465-X, page 168.

The general outline of this program is:

    1) given the Shannon probability, compute the abscissa
    value that divides the area under the normal curve,
    into two sections, such that the area to the left of
    the value, divided by the total area under the normal
    curve is the Shannon probability-a Newton-Raphson
    iterated approach using Romberg integration to find
    the area is used for this

    2) for each record:

        a) for each company

            i) compute a gaussian distributed random
            number

            ii) add the computed abscissa value from 1)
            above to the gaussian distributed random
            number

            iii) multiply this number by the fraction of
            aggregate sum of the market to be wagered

            iv) add this number to the cumulative sum for
            the company

            v) add this number to the temporary aggregate
            sum of the market

        b) add the temporary aggregate sum of the market
        to the aggregate sum of the market

This program will require finding the value of the normal
function, given the standard deviation. The method used is
to use Romberg/trapezoid integration to numerically solve
for the value.

This program will require finding the functional inverse
of the normal, ie., Gaussian, function. The method used is
to use Romberg/trapezoid integration to numerically solve
the equation:

                    x                2
                    |   1        - t   / 2
    F(x) = integral | ------ * e          dt + 0.5
                    | 2 * pi
                    0

which has the derivative:

                          2
             1        - x   / 2
    f(x) = ------ * e
           2 * pi

Since F(x) is known, and it is desired to find x,

                    x                2
                    |   1        - t   / 2
    F(x) - integral | ------ * e          dt + 0.5 = P(x)
                    | 2 * pi
                    0

                                                    = 0

and the Newton-Raphson method of finding roots would be:

                  P(x)
    P      = P  - ----
     n + 1    n   f(x)
