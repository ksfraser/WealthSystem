NAME
       tsrmswindow - take the windowed root mean square of a time series

SYNOPSIS
       tsrmswindow [-t] [-w size] [-v] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsrmswindow  is	for taking the root mean square of a time series.  The
       square of a value of a sample in the time series added to  the  cumula-
       tive  sum  of  the  square  of the samples to make a new time series by
       dividing the cumulative sum of the square of the samples by the	number
       of  samples, for each sample. The new time series is printed to stdout.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per	time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#'  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain	many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple's value at that time.

OPTIONS
       -t     Sample's time will be included in the output time series.

       -w size
	      Specifies the window size for the running average.

       -v     Print the version and copyright banner of the program.

       filename
	      Input filename.

WARNINGS
       There is little or no provision for handling numerical exceptions.
