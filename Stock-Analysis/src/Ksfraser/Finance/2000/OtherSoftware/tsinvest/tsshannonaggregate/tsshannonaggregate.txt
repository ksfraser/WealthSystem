NAME
       tsshannonaggregate - Calculate the aggregate Shannon probability

SYNOPSIS
       tsshannonaggregate [-p] [-v] Probability_1 Probability_2 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Tsshannonaggregate is for calculating the aggregate Shannon probability
       of many concurrent Shannon probabilities.

       Consider gambling on two unfair coin tossing games, at the  same  time,
       one  game  having a Shannon probability of 0.55, and the other having a
       Shannon probability of 0.65. Assuming that the coins in both games  are
       tossed  concurrently  for each iteration of the game, the combinatorics
       of the possible outcomes of wins and losses in each iteration are:

	   outcomes probability fraction    average

	   ll:	    0.157500  * -0.400000 = -0.063000
	   wl:	    0.192500  * -0.200000 = -0.038500
	   lw:	    0.292500  *  0.200000 =  0.058500
	   ww:	    0.357500  *  0.400000 =  0.143000

       where 'l' is a loss, and 'w' is a win, and the  probability  is	calcu-
       lated  by multiplying the individual probabilities of a loss or win for
       the respective coins, ie., for both coins to win, the probability would
       be  0.55 * 0.65 = 0.3575.  (1 - P is used for the probability of a loss
       for each coin.) The fraction is the fraction of	capital  waged	on  an
       individual  game, and is computed as optimal, from the equation 2P - 1,
       where P is the Shannon probability of the individual unfair coin and is
       either  0.55  or  0.65.	The  average is computed as the product of the
       probability and the fraction.

       What this means is that 35.75% of the time, a win-win outcome  will  be
       observed  in  the  iterated  games, and 15.75% of the time, a lose-lose
       outcome will be observed. The amount won in the win-win	scenario  will
       be  the sum of the fractions wagered on each coin, which is (2 * 0.55 -
       1) + (2 * 0.65 - 1) = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4. The product of this fraction and
       probability  is	the  contribution over many plays to the capital do to
       this outcome. Summing these averages for the different outcomes is  the
       average	over  many  plays of the capital growth by playing both games,
       and is numerically identical to the sum of the average of  the  normal-
       ized increments of both games.

       Since the average and root mean square of the normalized increments are
       related by:

	   rms = sqrt (average)

       squaring the average will be the root mean  square  of  the  normalized
       increments, or:

	   Average  rms      Shannon probability

	   0.100000 0.316228 0.658114

       where the Shannon probability, P, is computed by:

	       rms + 1	 1.316228
	   P = ------- = -------- = 0.658114
		  2	    2

       The  implication  is  that the two concurrent unfair coin tossing games
       could be "modeled" as a single  game  with  a  Shannon  probability  of
       0.658114.

       Although  it is generally more expedient just to sum, root mean square,
       the individual root mean square of the normalized  increments  of  each
       game,  (where f = rms = 2P - 1,) and then compute the Shannon probabil-
       ity by:

				     2			 2
	       sqrt (((2 * 0.55) - 1)  + ((2 * 0.65) - 1))  + 1
	   P = ------------------------------------------------
				     2

			2      2
	       sqrt (0.1  + 0.3 )  + 1	   sqrt (0.01 + 0.09) + 1
	     = -----------------------	 = ----------------------
			  2			      2

	       sqrt (0.1) + 1	0.316227766 + 1   1.316227766
	     = -------------- = --------------- = -----------
		     2		       2	       2

	     = 0.658113883

       this program does it with combinatorics.
