.SH NAME
tsgain \- find the gain of a time series
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
tsgain [-p] [-t] [-v] [filename]
tsgain -a avg -r rms
tsgain -P P -r rms
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tsgain is for finding the gain of a time series.  The value of a sample
in the time series added to the cumulative sum of the samples, and is
squared and added to the cumulative sum of squares, the Shannon probability, P,
calculated using:

        avg
        --- + 1
        rms
    P = -------
           2

where rms is the root mean square of the marginal returns, and avg is
the average of the marginal returns, and the gain, G, calculated
using:

                 P            P - 1
    G = (1 + rms)  * (1 - rms)

to make a new time series. The new time series is printed to stdout.

The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in
temporal order, one record per time series sample.  Blank records are
ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#' character as the
first non white space character in the record. Data records must
contain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but
may contain many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the
first field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as
the sample's value at that time.
