       Tsfraction  is for finding the fraction of change in a time series. The
       value of a sample in the time series is subtracted  from  the  previous
       sample  in  the  time  series, and divided by the value of the previous
       sample. The fraction time series is printed to stdout.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per  time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a '#'  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain  many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample's time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple's value at that time.
