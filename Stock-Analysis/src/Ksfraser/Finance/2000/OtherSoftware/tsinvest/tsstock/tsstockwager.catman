       Tsstockwager is for stock capital investment simulation. The idea is to
       simulate an optimal  wagering  strategy,  dynamically  determining  the
       Shannon  probability by counting the up movements in a stock's value in
       a window from the stock's value time series, and using this to  compute
       the  fraction  of the total capital to be invested in the stock for the
       next iteration of the time series, which is 2 * P - 1, where P  is  the
       Shannon  probability.  See,  "Fractals,  Chaos,  Power  Laws,"  Manfred
       Schroeder, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, New  York,  1991,  ISBN
       0-7167-2136-8, pp 128, 151. The assumption is that a stock's price time
       series could be modeled as a fixed increment fractal.

       --cc     Sample's value will be included in the output time series.

       --dd     Capital gains will be included in the output time series.

       --ff ff   Fraction of capital invested will be included in the output time
              series.

       --ii ii   Initial value of capital.

       --pp     Current  value  of  stock  will  be  included in the output time
              series.

       --ss     Sample's Shannon probability will be included in the output time
              series.

       --tt     Sample's time will be included in the output time series.

       --uu     Count sequential elements from the time series with equal magni-
              tude as an up movement in stock price.   (The  program  normally
              counts  two  sequential elements from the time series with equal
              magnitude as a down movement in the stock's price. The -u switch
              will have them counted as an up movement.)

       --ww ww   Window  sample  size  for  Shannon probability computation. (The
              number of sequential elements from the time series that will  be
              included  in the calculation of Shannon probability will be this
              number plus 1. For example, -w 3 will count 3 market  movements,
              from 4 sequential elements from the time series.)
