.SH DESCRIPTION
Tsstockwager is for stock capital investment simulation. The idea is
to simulate an optimal wagering strategy, dynamically determining the
Shannon probability by counting the up movements in a stock's value in
a window from the stock's value time series, and using this to compute
the fraction of the total capital to be invested in the stock for the
next iteration of the time series, which is 2 * P - 1, where P is the
Shannon probability. See, "Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws," Manfred
Schroeder, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, New York, 1991, ISBN
0-7167-2136-8, pp 128, 151. The assumption is that a stock's price
time series could be modeled as a fixed increment fractal.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Sample's value will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -d
Capital gains will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -f f
Fraction of capital invested will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -i i
Initial value of capital.
.TP
.B -p
Current value of stock will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -s
Sample's Shannon probability will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -t
Sample's time will be included in the output time series.
.TP
.B -u
Count sequential elements from the time series with equal magnitude as
an up movement in stock price.  (The program normally counts two
sequential elements from the time series with equal magnitude as a
down movement in the stock's price. The -u switch will have them
counted as an up movement.)
.TP
.B -w w
Window sample size for Shannon probability computation. (The number of
sequential elements from the time series that will be included in the
calculation of Shannon probability will be this number plus 1. For
example, -w 3 will count 3 market movements, from 4 sequential
elements from the time series.)
.TP
.B -v
Print the version and copyright banner of the program.
.TP
.B filename
Input filename.
.SH WARNINGS
