This directory contains shell script that uses the programs tscoin,
tssample, tsfraction, tsrms, tslogreturns, tsnormal, and tsshannon to
measure the probability of a time sampled Brownian fractal time series
as a function of sampling interval. This is useful for investigation
into modeling markets and stock prices as a time sampled fixed
increment Brownian motion.
