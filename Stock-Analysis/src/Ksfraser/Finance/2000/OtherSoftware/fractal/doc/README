    2) gnuplot
    3) gnuindex
    4) ispell
    5) rcs
    6) epsf.sty
    6) fancyheadings.sty
    7) auctex.sty
    9) rcs.sty

All programs are freely available, and ftp addresses are listed in the
colophon.

The documentation will require that all market data be compiled in the
../markets directory, and, additionally all programs and test cases be
compiled in the ../simulation, ../simulation/tests, ../utilities, and
../utilities/tests. The schematic graphics are in the graphics
directory.
