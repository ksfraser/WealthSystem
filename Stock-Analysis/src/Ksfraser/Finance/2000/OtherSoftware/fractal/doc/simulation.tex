    \subsection{Simulation of Fixed Increment Approximation for Fiscal Strategy}
        \label{\SETLABEL:TSUNFAIRBROWNIAN}

        \subidx{\market}{market simulation}
        The data in this section is presented in tabular form in
        Section~\ref{\SETLABELREF:SIM}.
        Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:TSUNFAIRBROWNIAN0} represents a
        constructional simulation of the time series data presented in
        Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:TS}. The program {\it
        tsunfairbrownian}\/, which is briefly described in
        appendix~\ref{programs}, was used in the reconstruction. The
        reconstructed data is superimposed on the original time series
        data.  The program, {\it tsunfairbrownian}\/, essentially,
        constructs the new time series as a Brownian fractal with
        fixed increments---the value of the fixed increment is derived
        from the root mean square average of the normalized increments
        presented in Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:TF}. The ``quality'' of
        such a reconstruction should be subject to adequate scepticism
        and scrutiny since, in all probability, the normalized
        increments presented in Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:TF} represent a
        relatively complex process, that may not be ``modeled'' with
        such a simple methodology.

        As a further comparison of the the constructional simulation
        with the original time series data,
        Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:TSUNFAIRBROWNIAN1} presents a normalized
        histogram of the normalized increments of the reconstructed
        time series, superimposed on the normalized histogram
        presented in Figure~\ref{\SETLABEL:NH}.

                        By comparison, the simulated data has a mean
                        of {\tsunfairbrownianfractionmean} with a
                        standard deviation of

                        is superimposed on the data presented in
