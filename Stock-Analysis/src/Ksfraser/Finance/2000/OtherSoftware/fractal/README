This directory is the top level directory for "Notes on the Fractal
Analysis of Various Market Segments in the North American Electronics
Industry." See the INSTALL file for installation procedures.

The documentation is written in LaTeX, and the following programs and
macros will be required to compile the sources:

    1) dvips
    2) gnuplot
    3) gnuindex
    4) ispell
    5) rcs
    6) epsf.sty
    6) fancyheadings.sty
    7) auctex.sty
    9) rcs.sty

All programs are freely available, and ftp addresses are listed in the
colophon.

In addition, an ANSI standard C compiler will be required to compile
the programs used in the analysis, although K&R compilers should
present few, if any, problems. If a top down compile is being used,
Appendix B in the documentation gives example usage and graphs of the
output of the programs, for comparative purposes-these generally are
from the regression tests in the ../utilities/test and
../simulation/test directories.

The directory inventory is:

        1) simulation, the fractal simulation programs .
        2) simulation/test, the regression tests for the fractal
           simulation programs.
        3) utilities, the fractal time series analytical utilities.
        4) utilities/test, the regression tests for the fractal
           time series analytical utilities.
        5) markets, top level directory for market data analysis.
        6) markets/Master, master directory for the Makefile, plot,
           and gnuplot files which are linked to each directory,
           where data for a market segment resides.
        7) markets/*, directories for the data construction for
           each market segment.
