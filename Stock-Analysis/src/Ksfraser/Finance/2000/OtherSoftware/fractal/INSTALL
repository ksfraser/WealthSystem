This directory is the top level directory for "Notes on the Fractal
Analysis of Various Market Segments in the North American Electronics
Industry." This file explains how to reconstruct and install the
necessary programs and data for the documenation in the "doc"
directory.

If a manual top down compile is necessary:

    1) cd simulation; make; cd ..
    2) cd utilities; make; cd test; make; cd ../../
    3) cd simulation/test; make; cd ../../
    4) cd markets; make; cd ..
    5) cd doc/graphics; make; cd ../../
    6) cd doc; make; cd ..
    7) cd doc; make fractal.ps; cd ..

The documentation will require that all market data be
compiled in the ../markets directory, and, additionally all programs
and test cases be compiled in the ../simulation, ../simulation/test,
../utilities, and ../utilities/test.
