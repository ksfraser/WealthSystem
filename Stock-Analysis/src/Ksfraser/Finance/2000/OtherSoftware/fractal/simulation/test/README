This is a test for the programs in ../utilities and
../../simulation. To test the programs, use the standard make
procedure to make the test cases. Be advised that this is an extremely
long process. The tests may be viewed using gnuplot, with the command
"gnuplot plot".  Some of the files are required for the LaTeX
documentation in ../../doc. The command "make" will construct the
files and data, the command "make clean" will remove all deciduous
files, and the command "make realclean" will remove all files,
excepting those files that are required to reconstruct the data and
files.
