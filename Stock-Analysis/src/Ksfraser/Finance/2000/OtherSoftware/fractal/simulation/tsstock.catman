       Tsstock is for simulating the gains of a stock investment using Shannon
       probability.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per  time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a ’#’  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain  many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample’s time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple’s value at that time.

       A  large  mathematical  infrastructure  of  analytical  techniques  and
       methodologies have been dedicated to the analysis of equity market time
       series.

       This program is an investigation into whether a stock price time series
       could  be  modeled  as a fractal Brownian motion time series, and, fur-
       ther, whether, a mechanical wagering strategy could be devised to opti-
       mize portfolio growth in the equity markets.

       Specifically,  the  paradigm is to establish an isomorphism between the
       fluctuations in a gambler’s capital in the  speculative  unfair  tossed
       coin game, as suggested in Schroeder, and speculative investment in the
       equity markets.  The advantage in doing this is that there is  a  large
       infrastructure  in  mathematics dedicated to the analysis and optimiza-
       tion of parlor games, specifically, the unfair tossed  coin  game.  See
       Schroeder reference.

       Currently,  there  is  a repository of historical price time series for
       stocks available at,

           http://www.ai.mit.edu/stocks.html

       that contains the historical price time  series  of  many  hundreds  of
       stocks.  The  stock’s  prices  are  by  close  of business day, and are
       updated daily.

       The stock price history files  in  the  repository  are  available  via
       anonymous   ftp,  (ftp.ai.mit.edu,)  and  the  programs  tsfraction(1),
       tsrms(1), tsavg(1), and tsnormal(1) can be used to verify  that,  as  a
       reasonable  first  approximation,  stock prices can be represented as a
       fractional Brownian motion  fractal,  as  suggested  by  Schroeder  and
       Crownover.   (Note  the  assumption  that,  as a first approximation, a
       stock’s price time series can be generated by independent  increments.)

       This  would  tend  to  imply  that  there is an isomorphism between the
       underlying mechanism that  produces  the  fluctuations  in  speculative
       stock  prices and the the mechanism that produces the fluctuations in a
       gambler’s capital that is speculating on iterations of an unfair tossed
       coin.

       If  this  is  a  reasonably accurate approximation, then the underlying
       mechanism of a stock’s price time series can be analyzed,  (by  "disas-
       sembling" the time series,) and a wagering strategy, similar to that of
       the optimal wagering strategy in the iterated unfair coin tossing game,
       can be formulated to optimize equity market portfolio growth.

       As  a note in passing, it is an important and subtile point, that there
       are "operational" differences in wagering on the iterated  unfair  coin
       game,  and wagering on a stock. Specifically, in the coin game, a frac-
       tion of the gambler’s capital is wagered on the speculative outcome  of
       the  toss  of  the coin, and, depending on whether the toss of the coin
       resulted in a win, (or a loss,) the wager is  added  to  the  gambler’s
       capital, (or subtracted from it,) respectively.  However, in the specu-
       lative stock game, the gambler wagers on the  anticipated  FLUCTUATIONS
       of the stock’s price, by purchasing the stock. The important difference
       is that the stock gambler does not win or  loose  an  amount  that  was
       equal  to  the stock’s price, (which was equivalent to the wager in the
       iterated unfair coin game,) but only the fluctuations  of  the  stock’s
       price,  ie., it is an important concept that a portfolio’s value (which
       has an investment in a stock,) and the stock’s price do not,  necessar-
       ily, "track" each other.

       In  some  sense,  wagering on a stock is NOT like a gambler wagering on
       the outcome of the toss of an unfair coin, but  like  wagering  on  the
       capital  of  the  gambler that wagered on the outcome of the toss of an
       unfair coin. A very subtile difference, indeed.

       Note that the paradigm of the isomorphism between wagering on  a  stock
       and  wagering  in  an  unfair tossed coin game is that the graph, (ie.,
       time series,) of the gambler’s capital, who is wagering on the iterated
       outcomes  of  an  unfair  tossed coin, and the graph of a stock’s price
       over time are statistically similar.

       If this is the case, at least in principle, it should  be  possible  to
       "dissect" the time series of both "games," and determine the underlying
       statistical mechanism of both. Further, it should be, at least in prin-
       ciple, possible to optimize portfolio growth of speculative investments
       in the equity markets using information-theoretic entropic  techniques.
       See Kelly, Pierce, Reza, and Schroeder.

       Under  these  assumptions,  the  amount  of capital won or lost in each
       iteration of the unfair tossed coin game would be:

           V(t) - V(t - 1)

       for all data points in the gambler’s capital time series.   This  would
       correspond to the amount of money won or lost on each share of stock at
       each interval in the stock price time series.

       Likewise, the normalized  increments  of  the  gambler’s  capital  time
       series  can be obtained by subtracting the value of the gambler’s capi-
       tal in the last interval from the value of the gambler’s capital in the
       current interval, and dividing by the value of the gambler’s capital in
       the last interval:

           V(t) - V(t - 1)
           ---------------
              V(t - 1)

       for all data points in the gambler’s capital time  series.  This  would
       correspond  to  the  fraction  of the gambler’s capital that was won or
       lost on each iteration of the game,  or,  alternatively,  the  fraction
       that the stock price increased or decreased in each interval.

       The  normalized  increments  are a very useful "tool" in analyzing time
       series data.  In the case of the unfair coin tossing game, the  normal-
       ized increments are a "graph," (or time series,) of the fraction of the
       capital that was won or lost, every iteration of the  game.  Obviously,
       in  the  unfair  coin game, to win or lose, a wager had to be made, and
       the graph of the absolute value, or more appropriately, the  root  mean
       square,  (the  absolute  value of the normalized increments, when aver-
       aged, is related to the root mean square of the increments  by  a  con-
       stant. If the normalized increments are a fixed increment, the constant
       is unity. If the normalized increments have  a  Gaussian  distribution,
       the  constant  is ~0.8 depending on the accuracy of of "fit" to a Gaus-
       sian distribution,) of the normalized increments is the fraction of the
       capital that was wagered on each iteration of the game. As suggested in
       Schroeder, if an unfair coin has a chance, P, of coming up heads, (win-
       ning) and a chance 1 - P, of coming up tails, (loosing,) then the opti-
       mal wagering strategy would be to wager a fraction, f, of the gambler’s
       capital, on every iteration of the game, that is:


           f = 2P - 1

       This  would  optimize  the exponential growth of the gambler’s capital.
       Wagering more than this value would result in less capital growth,  and
       wagering less than this value would result in less capital growth, over
       time. The variable f is also equal to the root mean square of the  nor-
       malized increments, rms, and the average, avg, of the normalized incre-
       ments is the constant of the average exponential  growth  of  the  gam-
       bler’s capital:

                           t
           C(t) = (1 + avg)

       where  C(t)  is the gambler’s capital. It can be shown that the formula
       for the probability, P, as a function of avg and rms is:

               avg
               --- + 1
               rms
           P = -------
                  2

       where the empirical measurement of avg and rms are:

                     n
                   -----
                 1 \     V(t) - V(t - 1)
           avg = -  >    ---------------
                 n /        V(t - 1)
                   -----
                   i = 0

       and,

                      n
                    -----                     2
              2   1 \      [ V(t) - V(t - 1) ]
           rms  = -  >     [ --------------- ]
                  n /      [   V(t - 1)      ]
                    -----
                    i = 0

       respectively, (additionally, note that these formulas can  be  used  to
       produce  the  running  average  and running root mean square, ie., they
       will work "on the fly.")

       The formula for the probability, P, will be true whether  the  game  is
       played optimally, or not, ie., the game we are "dissecting," may not be
       played with f = 2P - 1. However, the formula for the probability, P:

                rms + 1
           P’ = -------
                   2

       will be the same as P, only if the game is  played  optimally,  (which,
       also, is applicable in "on the fly" methodologies.)

       Interestingly,  the  measurement,  perhaps  dynamically,  (ie., "on the
       fly,") of the average and root mean square of the normalized increments
       is  all that is necessary to optimize the "play of the game." Note that
       if P’ is smaller than P, then we need to increase rms, by increasing f,
       and,  likewise,  if  P’  is larger than P, we need to decrease f. Thus,
       without knowing any of the underlying mechanism of  the  game,  we  can
       formulate  a  methodology  for  an optimal wagering strategy. (The only
       assumption being that the capital can be represented as an  independent
       increment  fractal-and,  this  too  can,  and  should, be verified with
       meticulous application of fractal analysis using the  programs  tsfrac-
       tion(1), tsrms(1), tsavg(1), and tsnormal(1).)

       At  this  point,  it  would seem that the optimal wagering strategy and
       analytical methodology used to optimize the  growth  of  the  gambler’s
       capital  in  the  the unfair tossed coin gain is well in hand. Unfortu-
       nately, when applying the methodology to the equity markets, one  finds
       that,  for  almost all stocks, P is greater than P’, perhaps tending to
       imply that in the equity markets, stocks are over priced.

       To illustrate a simple stock wagering strategy, suppose that analytical
       measurements  are made on a stock’s price time series, and it is found,
       conveniently, that P = P’, implying that f = rms, (after computing  the
       normalized  increments of the stock’s price time series and calculating
       avg, rms, P, and P’.)  Note that in the optimized unfair  coin  tossing
       game, that wagering a fraction, f = rms, of the gambler’s capital would
       optimize the exponential growth of the gambler’s capital, and that  the
       fluctuations,  over  time, of the gambler’s capital would simply be the
       normalized increments of the gambler’s capital. The root mean square of
       the  fluctuations,  over  time,  are the fraction of that the gambler’s
       capital wagered, over time.  To achieve an optimal strategy when wager-
       ing  on  a stock, the objective would be that the normalized increments
       in the value of the portfolio, and the root mean square  value  of  the
       normalized increments of the portfolio, also, satisfy the criteria, f =
       rms. Note that the fraction of the portfolio that is  invested  in  the
       stock  will  have  normalized  increments  that have a root mean square
       value that are the same as the root mean square value of the normalized
       increments of the stock.

       The  issue  is  to  determine  the fraction of the stock portfolio that
       should be invested in the stock such that that fraction of the  portfo-
       lio would be equivalent to the gambler wagering a fraction of the capi-
       tal on a coin toss. It is important to note that the optimized wagering
       strategy  used  by  the gambler, when wagering on the outcome of a coin
       toss, is to never wager the entire capital, but to hold some capital in
       reserve,  and  wager  only a fraction of the capital-and in the optimum
       case this wager fraction is f = rms. In a stock portfolio, even  though
       the  investment  is totally in stocks, it could be considered that some
       of this value is wagered, and the rest  held  in  reserve.  The  amount
       wagered  would  be the root mean square of the normalized increments of
       the stocks price, and the amount held in reserve would be the remainder
       of  the  portfolio’s  value. (Note the paradigm-there is an isomorphism
       between the fluctuating gambler’s capital in the  unfair  coin  tossing
       game,  and  the fluctuating value of a stock portfolio.)  In the simple
       case where P = P’, the fraction of the portfolio value that  should  be
       invested in the stock is f = root mean square of the stock’s normalized
       increments, which would be the same as f = 2P - 1, where P = ((avg/rms)
       +  1) / 2 or P = (rms + 1) / 2. Note that the fluctuations in the value
       of the portfolio do to the fluctuations in the stocks  price  would  be
       statistically similar to the fluctuations in the gambler’s capital when
       playing the unfair coin tossing game.

       This also leads to a generality, where P and P’ are not equal.  If  the
       root  mean  square of the normalized increments of the stock price time
       series are too small, say by a factor of 2, then the  fraction  of  the
       portfolio  invested  in the stock should be increased, by a factor of 2
       (in this example.) This would make the root mean square of the fluctua-
       tions  in  the  value  of  the  portfolio the same as the the root mean
       square of the fluctuations in the gambler’s capital under similar  sta-
       tistical  circumstances,  (albeit with twice as much of the portfolio’s
       equivalent "cash reserves" tied up in the investment in the stock.

       To calculate the ratio by which the fraction of the portfolio  invested
       in a stock must be increased:

               avg
               --- + 1
               rms
           P = -------
                  2

       and,

           f = 2P - 1 = rms

       and letting the measured rms by rms ,
                                          m

                           avg
                              m
                           ---- + 1
                           rms            avg
                              m              m
           f = 2P - 1 = 2  -------- - 1 = ---- = rms
                              2           rms
                                             m

           (Note that both of the values, avg and rms, are
           functions of the probability, P, but their ratio is
           not.)

       and  letting  F  be  the  ratio  by which the fraction of the portfolio
       invested in a stock must be increased to accommodate P not being  equal
       to P’:

                       avg
                rms       m
           F =  ---- = ----
                rms       2
                   m   rms
                          m

       and multiplying both sides of the equation by f, to get the fraction of
       the portfolio that should be invested in the stock while  accommodating
       P not being equal to P’:

                                    2
                   avg    avg    avg
                      m      m      m

                      2   rms       3
                   rms       m   rms
                      m             m

       which  can be computed, dynamically, or "on the fly," and where avg and
       rms are the average and root mean square of the  normalized  increments
       of  the  stock’s price time series, and assuming that the stock’s price
       time  series  is  composed  of  independent  increments,  and  can   be
       represented as a fractional Brownian motion fractal.

                  V(t - 1)

           2) calculate the, possibly running, average of all
           normalized increments in the stock’s price time series
           by the following equation:

                         n
                       -----
                     1 \     V(t) - V(t - 1)
               avg = -  >    ---------------
                     n /        V(t - 1)
                       -----
                       i = 0

           3) calculate the, possibly running, root mean square
           of all normalized increments in the stock’s price time
           series by the following equation:

                          n
                        -----                     2
                  2   1 \      [ V(t) - V(t - 1) ]
               rms  = -  >     [ --------------- ]
                      n /      [   V(t - 1)      ]
                        -----
                        i = 0

           4) calculate the, possibly running, fraction of the
           portfolio to be invested in the stock, F * f:

                          2
                       avg
                          m
               F * f = ----
                          3
                       rms
                          m

       To  reiterate  what  we  have  so  far, consider a gambler, iterating a
       tossed unfair coin. The gambler’s capital, over time, could be a repre-
       sented  as a Brownian fractal, on which measurements could be performed
       to optimize the gambler’s wagering strategy. There is  supporting  evi-
       dence  that stock prices can be "modeled" as a Brownian fractal, and it
       would seem reasonable that the optimization techniques that the gambler
       uses  could be applied to stock portfolios. As an example, suppose that
       it is desired to invest in a stock. We would measure  the  average  and
       root mean square of the normalized increments of the stock’s price time
       series to determine a wagering strategy for  investing  in  the  stock.
       Suppose  that  the measurement yielded that the the the fraction of the
       capital to be invested, f, was 0.2,  (ie.,  a  Shannon  probability  of
       0.6,)  then  we might invest the entire portfolio in the stock, and our
       portfolio would be modeled as 20% of the portfolio would be wagered  at
       any  time,  and 80% would be considered as "cash reserves," even though
       the 80% is actually invested in the stock. Additionally, we have a met-
       ric methodology, requiring only the measurement of the average and root
       mean square of the increments of the stock price time series, to formu-
       late  optimal  wagering  strategies  for investment in the stocks.  The
       assumption is that the stock’s price time series is composed  of  inde-
       pendent  increments,  and  can  be represented as a fractional Brownian
       motion fractal, both of which can be verified through a metric  method-
       ology.

       Note  the  isomorphism.  Consider a gambler that goes to a casino, buys
       some chips, then plays many iterations of an unfair coin tossing  game,
       and  then  cashes in the chips. Then consider investing in a stock, and
       some time later, selling the stock. If the Shannon probability  of  the
       time  series  of  the  unfair coin tossing game is the same as the time
       series of the stock’s value, then both "games" would  be  statistically
       similar.  In point of fact, if the toss of the unfair coin was replaced
       with whether the stock price movement was up or down, then the two time
       series  would be identical. The implication is that stock values can be
       modeled by an unfair tossed coin. In point of fact, stock  values  are,
       generally,  fractional Brownian motion in nature, implying that the day
       to day fluctuations in price can be modeled with a time sampled  unfair
       tossed coin game.

       There is an implication with the model. It would appear that the "best"
       portfolio strategy would be to  continually  search  the  stock  market
       exchanges  for  the stock that has the largest value of the quotient of
       the average and root mean square of the normalized  increments  of  the
       stock’s  price  time  series,  (ie., avg / rms,) and invest 100% of the
       portfolio in that single stock. This is in contention with the  concept
       that  a  stock  portfolio  should  be "diversified," although it is not
       clear that the prevailing concept of diversification has any scientific
       merit.

       To address the issue of diversification of stocks in a stock portfolio,
       consider the example where a gambler, tossing an unfair coin,  makes  a
       wager.   If the coin has a 60% chance of coming up heads, then the gam-
       bler should wager 20% of the capital on hand on the next  toss  of  the
       coin.  The  remaining  80% is kept as "cash reserves." It can be argued
       that the cash reserves are not being used to enhance  the  capital,  so
       the  gambler  should  play multiple games at once, investing all of the
       capital, investing 20% of the capital, in each  of  5  games  at  once,
       (assuming that the coins used in each game have a probability of coming
       up heads 60% of the time-note that the fraction of capital invested  in
       each  game would be different for each game if the probabilities of the
       coins were different, but could be measured by calculating the avg /rms
       of each game.)

       Likewise, with the same reasoning, we would expect that stock portfolio
       management would entail measuring the quotient of the average and  root
       mean  square  of  the normalized increments of every stock’s price time
       series, (ie., avg / rms,) choosing those stocks with the  largest  quo-
       tient,  and  investing a fraction of the portfolio that is equal to the
       this quotient. Note that with an avg / rms = 0.1, (corresponding  to  a
       Shannon  probability of 0.55-which is "typical" for the better perform-
       ing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,) we would expect the portfo-
       lio  to  be diversified into 10 stocks, which seems consistent with the
       recommendations of those purporting diversification of  portfolios.  In
       reality,  since most stocks in the United States exchanges, (at least,)
       seem to be "over priced," (ie., P larger than P’,) it  will  take  more
       capital  than  is  available  in  the value of the portfolio to invest,
       optimally, in all of the stocks in the portfolio, (ie., the fraction of
       the  portfolio that has to be invested in each stock, for optimal port-
       folio performance, will sum to greater than 100%.) The  interpretation,
       I  suppose,  in the model, is that at least a portion of the investment
       in each stock would be on "margin," which  is  a  relatively  low  risk
       investment, and, possibly, could be extended into a formal optimization
       of "buying stocks on the margin."

       The astute reader would  note  that  the  fractions  of  the  portfolio
       invested in each stock was added linearly, when these values are really
       the root mean square of the normalized increments, implying  that  they
       should  be  added root mean square. The rationale in linear addition is
       that the Hurst Coefficient in the near term is near unity, and for  the
       far  term 0.5. (By definition, this is the characteristic of a Brownian
       motion fractal process.)  Letting the Hurst Coefficient be H, then  the
       method of summing multiple processes would be:

            H      H    H
           V    = V  + V  + ...
            tot    1    2

       so  in the far term, the values would be added root mean square, and in
       the near term, linearly. Note that this is also a quantitative  defini-
       tion  of the terms "near term" and "far term."  Since the Hurst Coeffi-
       cient plot is on a log-log scale, the demarcation between the two terms
       is where 1 - ln (t) = 0.5 * ln (t), or when ln (t) = 2, or t = 7.389...
       The important point is that the "root mean square formula" used  varies
       with  time.  For the near term, H = 1, and linear addition is used. For
       the far term, a root mean square  summation  process  is  used.  (Note,
       also,  that  a far term H of 0.5 is unique to Brownian motion fractals.
       In general, it can be different than 0.5. If it  is  larger  than  0.5,
       then it is termed fractional Brownian motion, depending on who is doing
       the defining.)

       There are some interesting implications  to  this  near  term/far  term
       interpretation. First, the "forecastability" is better in the near term
       than far term-which could be interpreted as  meaning  that  short  term
       strategies  would  yield  better  portfolio  performance than long term
       strategies-see the Peters reference, pp. 83-84.  Secondly,  it  can  be
       used  to  optimize  portfolio  long term strategy. For example, suppose
       that a stock’s Shannon probability is 0.52, and all stocks in the port-
       folio  have the same Shannon probability. This means that the portfolio
       should consist of 25 stocks. However, in the long  run,  the  portfolio
       would  have  a  root  mean  square value of the square root of 25 times
       0.04, or 0.2. This would tend to imply that, on the average,  over  the
       long  run,  the stock portfolio would be one fifth of the total invest-
       ments. Naturally, this ratio could be adjusted, over time, depending on
       the  instantaneous  value of the Shannon probabilities of all different
       investments, like bonds, metals, etc.

       This would imply that "timing of the market" would have to be initiated
       to adjust the ratio of investment in stocks. One of the implications of
       entropic theory is that this is impossible.  However,  as  the  Shannon
       probability  of  the various investments change, statistical estimation
       can be used to asses the statistical accuracy of these  movements,  and
       the  ratios adjusted accordingly. This would tend to suggest that adap-
       tive computational control system methodology would  be  an  applicable
       alternative.

       As  a  note in passing, the average and root mean square of the normal-
       ized increments of a stock’s price time series, avg  and  rms,  respec-
       tively,  represent a qualitative metric of the stock. The average, avg,
       is an expression of the stock’s growth in  price,  and  the  root  mean
       square,  rms, is a expression of the stock’s price volatility. It would
       seem, incorrectly, at first glance that stocks should be selected  that
       have  high price growth, and low price volatility-however, it is a more
       complicated issue since avg and rms are interrelated, and not  indepen-
       dent of each other. See the references for theoretical concepts.

       In  the  diversified  portfolio,  the  "volatilities" of the individual
       stocks add root mean square to the volatility of the  portfolio  value,
       so, everything else being equal, we would expect that the volatility of
       the portfolio value to be about 1 /3 the volatility of the stocks  that
       make  up the portfolio. (The ratio 1 / came from square root of 1 / 10,
       which is about 1 / 3.) (There is a qualification here,  it  is  assumed
       that all stock price time series are made up of independent increments,
       and can be represented as a  fractional  Brownian  motion  fractal-note
       that  this statement is not true if the time series is characterized as
       simple Brownian motion, like the gambler’s capital in the  unfair  coin
       toss game-see Schroeder, pp. 157 for details.)  So, it can be supposed,
       if one desires maximum performance  in  a  stock  portfolio,  then  one
       should  search  the  stock  market exchanges for the stock that has the
       highest quotient of the average and root mean square of the  normalized
       increments of stock price time series, and invest 100% of the portfolio
       in that stock. As an alternative  strategy,  one  could  diversify  the
       portfolio,  investing  in  multiple  stocks,  and  lower  the portfolio
       volatility at the expense of lower  portfolio  performance.   Arguments
       can probably be made for both strategies.

       As  a  note in passing, I have made the statement that, at least in the
       United States exchanges, stocks tend to be over priced.  The  rationale
       behind  the  statement  is as follows. If the stock’s price time series
       represents an independent increment, fractional Brownian  fractal,  and
       if the stock’s price performance is optimal, then the equation:

           f = 2P - 1

       where  P  is the Shannon probability for the stock’s price time series,
       and f is the fraction of the capital wagered per game, (or  unit  time,
       and  where  the  capital is the stock’s price,) will represent fluctua-
       tions in the stock’s price, since the symbol f is also  the  root  mean
       square  value  of the normalized increments of the stock’s time series.
       Also, the absolute value of the time derivative of  the  stock’s  price
       time  series  is  the  fluctuations  in  the  stocks price, ie., at any
       instant, if V is the stock’s price, then fV will be the fluctuation  in
       price,  which  is the derivative, D, or, V = D / f. In other words, the
       fair market value of the stock, in relation to  the  normalized  incre-
       ments  of  the  stock’s  value,  will  be the derivative of the stock’s
       price, divided by the root mean square of the normalized increments  of
       the stock’s price, which is also f. If the argument has merit, then, at
       least the stocks available from http://www.ai.mit.edu/stocks.html would
       seem  to  be  over  priced. (It is a straight forward shell programming
       exercise, using the programs tsderivative(1), tsfraction(1), tsmath(1),
       and tsrms(1), to verify this.)

       A  final  derivation,  following Reza and Kelly. Consider the case of a
       gambler with a private wire into the future who places  wagers  on  the
       outcomes of a game of chance. We assume that the side information which
       he receives has a probability, P, of being true, and of 1 - P, of being
       false.  Let the original capital of gambler be V(0), and V(n) his capi-
       tal after the n’th wager. Since the gambler is  not  certain  that  the
       side information is entirely reliable, he places only a fraction, f, of
       his capital on each wager. Thus, subsequent to n many wagers,  assuming
       the independence of successive tips from the future, his capital is:

                         w       l
           V(n) = (1 + f) (1 - f) V(0)

       where  w  is  the  number of times he won, and l = n - w, the number of
       times he lost. These numbers are, in general, values taken by two  ran-
       dom  variables,  denoted by W and L. According to the law of large num-
       bers:

                         1
           lim           - W = P
           n -> infinity n

       and:

                         1
           lim           - L = q = 1 - P
           n - >infinity n

       The problem with which the gambler is faced is the determination  of  f
       leading to the maximum of the average exponential rate of growth of his
       capital. That is, he wishes to maximize the value of:

                             1     V(n)
           G = lim           - log ---
               n -> infinity n     V(0)

       with respect to f, assuming a fixed original capital and specified P:

                             W               L
           G = lim           - log (1 + f) + - log (1 - f)
               n -> infinity n               n

       or:

           G = P log (1 + f) + q log (1 - f)

       which, by taking the derivative with respect  to  f,  and  equating  to
       zero, can be shown to have a maxima when:

           dG           P - 1        1 - P
           -- = P(1 + f)      (1 - f)
           df

                                  1 - P - 1        P
               - (1 - P) (1 - f)           (1 + f)  = 0

       combining terms:

                   P - 1        1 - P                  P        P
           P(1 + f)      (1 - f)      - (1 - P) (1 - f)  (1 + f)

               = 0

       and splitting:

                   P - 1        1 - P                  P        P
           P(1 + f)      (1 - f)      = (1 - P) (1 - f)  (1 + f)

       taking the logarithm of both sides:

           ln (P) + (P - 1) ln (1 + f) + (1 - P) ln (1 - f) =

               ln (1 - P) - P ln (1 - f) + P ln (1 + f)

       combining terms:


           (P - 1) ln (1 + f) - P ln (1 + f) +

               (1 - P) ln (1 - f) + P ln (1 - f) = ln (1 - P)

               - ln (P)

       or:

           ln (1 - f) - ln (1 + f) =l n (1 - P) - ln (P)

       and performing the logarithmic operations:


              1 - f      1 - P
           ln ----- = ln -----
              1 + f        P

       and exponentiating:

           1 - f   1 - P
           ----- = -----
           1 + f     P

       which reduces to:

           P(1 - f) = (1 - P) (1 + f)

       and expanding:

           P - Pf = 1 - Pf - P + f

       or:

           P = 1 - P + f

       and, finally:

           f = 2P - 1

       As  a  passing note, the methodology used in this derivation comes from
       information-theoretic concepts, formally  called  entropic  principles,
       and is firmly entrenched branch of market and economic analysis.

       Continuing with the derivation of the methodology used herein, consider
       a gambler, wagering on the iterated outcomes of an unfair  tossed  coin
       game.  A  fraction,  f, of the gambler’s capital will be wagered on the
       outcome of each iteration of the unfair tossed coin, and  if  the  coin
       comes up heads, with a probability, P, then the gambler wins the itera-
       tion, (and an amount equal to the wager is added to the gambler’s capi-
       tal,) and if the coin comes up tails, with a probability of 1 - P, then
       the gambler looses the iteration, (and an amount of the wager  is  sub-
       tracted from the gambler’s capital.)

       As  a passing note, the iterations of a random variable, a flipped coin
       in this case, that are added together (ie., to a cumulative  sum,)  the
       gambler’s  capital,  in  this case, are called "fractal" processes. The
       origins of the name are recent and obscure,  but  there  are  different
       varieties of fractal processes. In this case, since the distribution of
       the increments is either plus or minus one, it  is  called  a  Brownian
       motion  fractal.  If the distribution of the increments had a Gaussian,
       or normal distribution, it would be called a fractional Brownian motion
       fractal.  (Typically  distribution  of  the increments in a stock price
       time series fall someplace in between the two.) The analytical  method-
       ology  of investigation into such matters is called "fractal analysis,"
       and that is what is going to be done here, in  general,  for  the  gam-
       bler’s capital, which is a Brownian motion fractal.

       If  we let the outcome of the first coin toss, (ie., whether it came up
       as a win or a loss,) be c(1) and the outcome  of  the  second  toss  be
       c(2), and so on, then the outcome of the n’th toss, c(n), would be:

                  [win, with a probability of P
           c(n) = [
                  [loose, with a probability of 1 - P

       for convenience, let a win to be represented by +1, and a loss by -1:

                  [+1, with a probability of P
           c(n) = [
                  [-1, with a probability of 1 - P

       for  the reason that when we multiply the wager, f, by c(n), it will be
       a positive number, (ie., the wager will be added to the  capital,)  and
       for  a loss, it will be a negative number, (ie., the wager will be sub-
       tracted from the capital.)  This is convenient, since the increment, by
       with the gambler’s capital increased or decreased in the n’th iteration
       of the game is f * c(n).

       If we let C(0) be the initial value of the gambler’s capital,  C(1)  be
       the  value  of  the  gambler’s capital after the first iteration of the
       game, then:

           C(1) = C(0) * (1 + c(1) * f(1))

       after the first iteration of the game, and:

           C(2) = C(0) * ((1 + c(1) * f(1)) * (1 + c(2) * f(2)))

       after the second iteration of the game, and, in general, after the n’th
       iteration of the game:

           C(n) = C(0) *

                  ((1 + c(1) * f(1)) * (1 + c(2) * f(2)) * ...

                  * (1 + c(n) * f(n)) * (1 + c(n + 1)

                  * f(n + 1)))

       For the normalized increments of the time series of the gambler’s capi-
       tal, it would be convenient to rearrange these formulas. For the  first
       iteration of the game:

           C(1) - C(0) = C(0) * (1 + c(1) * f(1)) - C(0)

       or

           C(1) - C(0)   C(0) * (1 + c(1) * f(1)) - C(0)
           ----------- = -------------------------------
              C(0)                   C(0)

       and  after  reducing,  the  first normalized increment of the gambler’s
       capital time series is:

           C(1) - C(0)
           ----------- = (1 + c(1) * f(1)) - 1 = c(1) * f(1)
              C(0)

       and for the second iteration of the game:

           C(2) = C(0) * ((1 + c(1) * f(1)) * (1 + c(2) * f(2)))

       but C(0) * ((1 + c(1) * f(1)) is simply C(1):

           C(2) = C(1) * (1 + c(2) * f(2))

       or:

           C(2) - C(1) = C(1) * (1 + c(2) * f(2)) - C(1)

       which is:

           C(2) - C(1)   C(1) * (1 + c(2) * f(2)) - C(1)
           ----------- = -------------------------------
              C(1)                    C(1)

       and after reducing, the second normalized increment  of  the  gambler’s
       capital time series is:

           C(2) - C(1)
           ----------- = 1 + c(2) * f(2)) - 1 = c(2) * f(2)
              C(1)

       and it should be obvious that the process can be repeated indefinitely,
       so, the n’th normalized increment of the gambler’s capital time  series
       is:

           C(n) - C(n - 1)
           --------------- = c(n) * f(n)
                C(n)

       Note  that  we  can  tell  the fraction of the capital that the gambler
       wagered in the n’th iteration, it is simply the absolute value  of  the
       normalized  increment  for  the iteration, | c(n) * f(n) |, ie., c(n) *
       f(n) is what was won or lost in the n’th iteration, and removing c(n) =
       plus  or  minus  1,  is the fraction of the wager. Another, more formal
       alternative, is to square the n’th normalized increment, (which,  also,
       removes  any  negative  sign,)  and  then  take  the square root of the
       square. Which leads to the formalization for the root  mean  square  of
       the  normalized  increments,  rms,  (provided  that  n  is sufficiently
       large):

                      n
                    -----                     2
              2   1 \      [ C(t) - C(t - 1) ]
           rms  = -  >     [ --------------- ]
                  n /      [   C(t - 1)      ]
                    -----
                    i = 0

       This is an important concept, since it shows that rms = f, or:

                      n
                    -----
              2   1 \       2   1      2    2
           rms  = -  >     f  = - n * f  = f
                  n /           n
                    -----
                    i = 0

       or, importantly:

           rms = f

       For the he average, avg, of the normalized increments of the  gambler’s
       capital, consider that in an interval of n many iterations of the game,
       (provided that n is sufficiently large,) there will be P many wins, and
       1  - P many losses, and since the gambler’s capital increased by +f for
       the wins, and -f for the losses, or:

           avg = f * [P - (1 - P)] = f * (2P - 1)

       but since f = rms:

           avg = rms * (2P - 1)

       or:

           avg
           --- = 2P - 1
           rms

       and rearranging:

                avg
           2P = --- + 1
                rms

       and solving for P:

               avg
               --- + 1
               rms
           P = -------
                  2

       Which is the formula for the Shannon probability, P, as a  function  of
       the  average  and  root mean square of the normalized increments of the
       gambler’s capital, avg and rms, respectively. It is an  important  con-
       cept  that  with the measurement of these two quantities, (and the met-
       rics on these two quantities can be deduced  dynamically,  or  "on  the
       fly,")  that an optimal wagering strategy, (or cash flow optimization,)
       can be formulated.

       It should be noted that this derivation is for analyzing a time  series
       that  is  characterized as a Brownian motion fractal. A similar deriva-
       tion can be used for time series that are characterized  by  fractional
       Brownian motion. However, the derivation is much more formidable, math-
       ematically.

       As a matter of practical interest, the term "provided that n is  suffi-
       ciently  large" needs to be qualified. Note that when the term "running
       average" or "running root mean square" is used, we really need to  know
       how  many  iterations of coin tosses, n, are necessary to be considered
       "sufficiently large." If we consider the formula:

               avg
               --- + 1
               rms
           P = -------
                  2

       and noting that the Shannon probability, P, has a range 0 <=  P  <=  1,
       and  we are using a summing process for both the average, and root mean
       square of the normalized increments, then n would have  to  be  100  to
       achieve a somewhat less than 1% error in P. The reasoning is that if we
       sum 100 ones, then the resultant sum would be 100, and the next  itera-
       tion  that  is  to be added to the sum could create at most a 1% error.
       The implication of this is that one should use a window of at least 100
       time  units.  (hours,  days, weeks, or whatever is being used as a unit
       time in the time series being analyzed,) to achieve  a  1%,  or  better
       uncertainty  in  P.  In  stock  price  performance  analysis, this is a
       marginal accuracy, so a larger window size would be recommended. A more
       formal  methodology  would  use  the program tsstatest(1) to determine,
       precisely, the size of the data set required.

       As a few examples of using very simple programs to perform fractal met-
       ric analysis on stock time series:

           tscoin -p 0.6 2500

       would  generate a fractal time series characterized by optimal Brownian
       motion consisting of 2500 records, and a  Shannon  probability,  P,  of
       0.6.

           tscoins -p 0.6 2500

       would  generate  a  fractal  time series characterized by optimal frac-
       tional Brownian motion consisting of 2500 records, and a Shannon proba-
       bility, P, of 0.6.

           tscoins -p 0.6 -f 0.55 2500

       would generate a fractal time series characterized by non-optimal frac-
       tional Brownian motion consisting of 2500 records, and a Shannon proba-
       bility, P, of 0.6, with a wagering fraction of 0.1.

           tscoins -p 0.6 -f 0.55 2500 | tsfraction

       would generate the normalized increments of a fractal time series char-
       acterized by non-optimal fractional Brownian motion consisting of  2500
       records, and a Shannon probability, P, of 0.6, with a wagering fraction
       of 0.1.

           tscoins -p 0.6 -f 0.55 2500 | tsfraction | tsavg -p
           tscoins -p 0.6 -f 0.55 2500 | tsfraction | tsrms -p

       would generate average and the  root  mean  square  of  the  normalized
       increments  of a fractal time series characterized by non-optimal frac-
       tional Brownian motion consisting of 2500 records, and a Shannon proba-
       bility, P, of 0.6, with a wagering fraction of 0.1.

           tsfraction my.stock | tsavg -p
           tsfraction my.stock | tsrms -p

       would  measure  the  average and the root mean square of the normalized
       increments of the stock time series, my.stock.

       It would be convenient to consolidate the various programs into a  sin-
       gle monolithic architecture for the analysis and simulation of wagering
       strategies of stock market time series.  It would, further,  be  conve-
       nient, from a comparative standpoint, to let value of the portfolio, at
       time zero, be the same as the price of a single stock at the  beginning
       of  the  simulation,  so  that  the  portfolio value using the wagering
       strategy to invest in a single stock can be compared to  the  price  of
       the  stock, over time. To reiterate the previous concepts, suppose that
       the measurement yielded that the the the fraction of the capital to  be
       invested,  f,  was  0.2,  (ie.,  a Shannon probability of 0.6,) then we
       might invest the entire portfolio in the stock, and our portfolio would
       be  modeled  as  20% of the portfolio would be wagered at any time, and
       80% would be considered as "cash reserves,"  even  though  the  80%  is
       actually invested in the stock. Assume the following pseudo code:

           calculate the average and root mean square of the
           normalized increments, avg and rms, respectively

           capital = value of stock at time 0, (ie., the
                                               portfolio value at
                                               time zero, is one
                                               share of stock)

                           2
                        avg    1
           multiplier = ---- * -, (ie., the value of the
                           3   f  multiplier, F * f in the
                        rms       derivations, by which the
                                  fraction of the capital that
                                  is to be wagered must be
                                  increased, ie., F = m
                                  multiplier)

           for each time interval, (ie., for each increment in
           the time series)

               if not the first interval?, (ie., we need to
                                           calculate the
                                           normalized increments,
                                           so the first interval
                                           can not be used)

                   capital =
                       lastcapital * multiplier *
                       (1 + increment), (ie., this is the new
                                        capital for today)

                   lastcapital = capital, (ie., this is
                                          yesterday’s capital,
                                          tomorrow)

       where  the  increment  is  calculated by subtracting todays stock value
       from yesterday’s stock value, and dividing by yesterday’s stock value:

                      V(t) - V(t - 1)
          increment = ---------------
                         V(t - 1)

       Note that:

           capital = lastcapital * multiplier * (1 + increment)

           capital =

                                               V(t) - V(t - 1)
               lastcapital * multiplier * (1 + ---------------)
                                                  V(t - 1)

           capital =

                                                 V(t)
               lastcapital * multiplier * (1 + -------- - 1)
                                               V(t - 1)

                                                  V(t)
           capital = lastcapital * multiplier * --------
                                                V(t - 1)

       which, not surprisingly, if multiplier = 1, (ie., P = P’):

                                     V(t)
           capital = lastcapital * --------
                                   V(t - 1)

       meaning that the portfolio value would track the stock’s value,  as  we
       would  expect. Likewise, if multiplier is greater than 1, the portfolio
       value would linearly track the stock value, by a  constant  of  propor-
       tionality,  and the amount of the portfolio invested in the stock would
       be greater than the value of the portfolio,  possibly  indicating  that
       the  the  remainder of the stock investment was purchased on margin. If
       the program is used to determine the fraction of the portfolio that  is
       to be invested in a specific stock, then the fraction can be calculated
       from:

           f = 2P - 1

       and:

          fraction = multiplier * f

       The command line option to for this print output is -p.

       It would also be desirable to be able to  automatically  determine  the
       number  of  stocks that should be held. The total capital invested in a
       stock is:

           capital * multiplier

       and dividing this value by the current value of the stock will give the
       number  of  stocks  that should be invested in. The command line option
       for this print output is -n, and the complete accounting of the portfo-
       lio  is  printed out, ie., value of portfolio, value of cash, and value
       of stocks held.

       The -f command line option takes a single argument,  and  modifies  the
       value  of  multiplier. The default value is unity, and it is useful for
       evaluating modifications to the portfolio wager strategy.

       The -T command line option prints the "theoretical" maximum gains  that
       are  attainable  with a stock. The algorithm simply "looks ahead," into
       the future, one day, to make a decision on whether to hold all  stocks,
       or  sell  all  stocks.  This  option is, obviously, only available when
       operating on stock histories, but  is  useful  for  comparing  a  wager
       strategy against the maximum attainable growth value of a stock.

       The -m command line option disables operations with the variable multi-
       plier. It simply sets it to unity, and again, is useful for comparative
       analysis, to observe the effects of the multiplier operation on portfo-
       lio value growth.

       The -i command line option takes a single argument, which is the amount
       of  initial capital in the portfolio, in currency units. If this option
       is not specified, then the initial value of one share of stock is  used
       as the initial portfolio value.

       The  -t  option  specifies  that time units, which, if available as the
       first column of the input file, should be printed to  the  output  file
       with the running value of the portfolio stock.

       The -v option prints a list of the options.

       The  -w  option takes a single argument that specifies a running window
       size that is used in the calculation  of  the  average  and  root  mean
       square  of  the  normalized  increments of the stock price time series.
       This is useful for using the program to calculate, dynamically, or  "on
       the fly," stock buy/sell advisories for portfolio management.

       Note that the portfolio investment simulation model is very simple, and
       assumes perfect liquidity of the stock, (ie., as many as necessary  can
       be bought or sold at exactly the day’s closing price of the stock,) and
       that there are no transaction commissions.
