       tscoins  is for generating fractional brownian noise, with unfair bias,
       and cumulative sum-generates a time series.  The idea is to  produce  a
       1/f  squared power spectrum distribution by running a cumulative sum on
       a Gaussian power spectrum distribution. The program accepts  an  unfair
       bias and a wager factor.  See "Fractals", Jens Feder, Plenum Press, New
       York, New York, 1988, ISBN 0-306-42851-2, pp 172.

       The name, tscoins, was chosen since pitching many coins, at  once,  and
       counting the number of heads, many times, will approach a gaussian dis-
       tribution, if the number of coins is large, and the number of times  is
       large.  See  "Fractals",  Jens Feder, Plenum Press, New York, New York,
       1988, ISBN 0-306-42851-2, pp 154.

       The discreet time formula is:

           x[t] = x[t - 1] + f * R * x[t - 1]

       where f is the fraction of the capital to be wagered, and R is a  Gaus-
       sian  function, with the mean offset appropriately to provide a Shannon
       probability, P. For the logistic function, the  discreet  time  formula
       is:

           x[t] = x[t - 1] + f * R * x[t - 1] + n * x[t - 1]^2

       Note: these programs use the following functions from other references:

           ran1, which returns a uniform random deviate between
           0.0 and 1.0. See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of
           Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian

           0-521-35465-X, page 210, referencing Knuth.

           gasdev, which returns a normally distributed deviate
           with zero mean and unit variance, using ran1 () as the
           source of uniform deviates. See "Numerical Recipes in
           C: The Art of Scientific Computing," William H. Press,

           1988, ISBN 0-521-35465-X, page 217.

           gammln, which returns the log of the results of the
           gamma function.  See "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art
           of Scientific Computing," William H. Press, Brian
           P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,

       The general outline of this program is:

           1) given the Shannon probability, compute the abscissa
           value that divides the area under the normal curve,
           into two sections, such that the area to the left of
           the value, divided by the total area under the normal
           curve is the Shannon probability-a Newton-Raphson
           iterated approach using Romberg integration to find
           the area is used for this

           2) for each record:

               a) compute a gaussian distributed random number

               b) add the computed abscissa value from 1) above
               to the gaussian distributed number

               c) multiply this number by the fraction of
               cumulative sum to be wagered

               d) multiply this number by the cumulative sum

               e) add this number to the cumulative sum

       This program will require finding the value  of  the  normal  function,
       given  the standard deviation. The method used is to use Romberg/trape-
       zoid integration to numerically solve for the value.

       This program will require finding the functional inverse of the normal,
       ie.,  Gaussian,  function.  The method used is to use Romberg/trapezoid
       integration to numerically solve the equation:

                           x                2
                           |   1        - t   / 2
           F(x) = integral | ------ * e          dt + 0.5
                           | 2 * pi
                           0

       which has the derivative:

                                 2
                    1        - x   / 2
           f(x) = ------ * e
                  2 * pi

       Since F(x) is known, and it is desired to find x,

                           x                2
                           |   1        - t   / 2
           F(x) - integral | ------ * e          dt + 0.5 = P(x)
                           | 2 * pi
                           0

                                                           = 0

       and the Newton-Raphson method of finding roots would be:

                         P(x)
           P      = P  - ----
            n + 1    n   f(x)
