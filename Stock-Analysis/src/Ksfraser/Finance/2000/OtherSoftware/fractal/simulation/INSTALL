To install the programs, use the standard make procedure in this
directory. If all goes well, compile the ../utilities directory and
change back to this directory, and then to the test directory, and use
the standard make procedure to make the test cases.  Be advised that
this is an extremely long process; for example, about 5 hours on a
20Mhz 386. If all goes well, install the following programs in the
executable path:

    tsblack
    tsbrownian
    tsdlogistic
    tsfBm
    tsfractional
    tsgaussian
    tsintegers
    tslogistic
    tspink
    tsunfairbrownian
    tsunfairfractional
    tswhite
    tscoin
    tscoins
    tsstockwager
    tsbinomial
    tsshannonstock
    tsmarket
    tsstock
    tsstocks
    tstrade
    tstradesim
    tscauchy
    tslognormal
    tslaplacian

Install the man pages to the programs in the man path:

    tsblack.1
    tsbrownian.1
    tsdlogistic.1
    tsfBm.1
    tsfractional.1
    tsgaussian.1
    tsintegers.1
    tslogistic.1
    tspink.1
    tsunfairbrownian.1
    tsunfairfractional.1
    tswhite.1
    tscoin.1
    tscoins.1
    tsstockwager.1
    tsbinomial.1
    tsshannonstock.1
    tsmarket.1
    tsstock.1
    tsstocks.1
    tstrade.1
    tstradesim.1
    tscauchy.1
    tslognormal.1
    tslaplacian.1

or

where the catman files have already been made by:

    nroff -man file.1 > file.catman

for those systems that do not support nroff.

The programs are written in ANSI standard C, but there is little or no
provisions for handling numerical exceptions. Usually, a great deal of
analytical skill is required in an interactive analysis of fractal
time series, and should probably not be attempted by the novice for
other than academic purposes.
