       Tsunfairfractional  is  for generating unfair returns of a time series.
       The idea is to produce the returns of a time series which  is  weighted
       unfairly,  by  a  Shannon probability, p. The input time series is pre-
       sumed to have a Gaussian distribution. The main function of  this  pro-
       gram  is  regression  scenario  verification-given  an  empirical  time
       series, a Shannon probability, and  a  "wager"  fraction,  (which  were
       probably  derived  from  the program tsshannon,) speculative market pro
       forma performance can be analyzed. The cumulative sum process is  frac-
       tional Brownian in nature.

       Note: Conceptually, this program is used to ‘‘weight’’ the returns of a
       time series with a Gaussian distribution,  ie.,  produce  a  fractional
       Brownian motion time series, as opposed to a Brownian distribution. The
       program should be regarded as experimental, and used with caution.
