       Tsmath  for  for  performing arithmetic operations on each element in a
       time series. The resultant time series is printed to stdio.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per  time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a ’#’  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain  many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample’s time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple’s value at that time.

       --aa nn   Add the number n to each element in the time series.

       --bb     Take the absolute value of each element in the time series.

       --dd nn   Divide each element in the time series by the number n.

       --ee     Exponentiate each element in the time series.

       --ll     Take the logarithm of each element in the time series.

       --LL     Find the minimum value in the time series.

       --MM     Find the maximum value in the time series.

       --mm nn   Multiply each element in the time series by the number n.

       --pp nn   Raise each element in the time series to the power n.

       --RR     Take the square root of each element in the time series.

       --SS     Square each element in the time series.

       --ss nn   Subtract the number n from each element in the time series.

       --tt     Sample’s time will be included in the output time series.
