       Tsunfraction is for making a cumulative sum of the fraction  of  change
       in  a  time  series. The value of a sample in the time series is multi-
       plied by the running cumulative sum of the time series,  and  added  to
       the  running  sum  of  the  time  series.  The resultant time series is
       printed to stdout. (This program is the inverse  of  the  tsfraction(1)
       program.) Note that:

           tsfraction data | tsunfraction

       does nothing. An interesting application of this program is:

           tsgaussian -t 10000 | tsmath -t -m 0.01
           | tsmath -t -a 0.0003 | tsunfraction

       which would manufacture a data file with statistics that are similar to
       equity market indices.

       The input file structure is a text file consisting of records, in  tem-
       poral  order,  one  record  per  time series sample.  Blank records are
       ignored, and comment records are signified by a ’#’  character  as  the
       first  non  white space character in the record. Data records must con-
       tain at least one field, which is the data value of the sample, but may
       contain  many fields-if the record contains many fields, then the first
       field is regarded as the sample’s time, and the last field as the  sam-
       ple’s value at that time.
